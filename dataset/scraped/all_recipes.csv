This partial mash blonde ale recipe from Chris Colby is lighter in color and drier than could be made with malt extract alone. The beer is not meant to be the driest or lightest possible, but simply on that end of the spectrum. (For an even drier, lighter beer, swap sucrose for some of the malt extract.) Use fresh malts and malt extract—and pay extra attention to cleaning and sanitation—to get the best bready malt character balanced by the hop aromatics.

Final Gravity: 1.010 (2.6°P)
ABV: 4.5%
IBU: 21
SRM: 6-7","Directions:
Make yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. In your brew pot, heat 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) brewing liquor to 161°F (72°C). Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and submerge in brew pot. Mash at 150°F (66°C) for 45 minutes, stirring and heating briefly every 10 minutes to maintain the mash temperature. In a separate pot, heat 5 qt. (4.7 L) water to 170°F (77°C).
When the mash is done, do not conduct a mash-out step. Lift bag above brew pot and let it drip until you can move the bag of grain to a 2-gallon beverage cooler without splattering too much. Scoop or pour the wort from the brew pot into the cooler. Recirculate the wort until it clears a bit, then run off.
Sparge steadily over 60 minutes. To do so, collect about a cup (250 mL) of wort from the cooler every 90 seconds, then add the same volume of hot water to the top of the grain bed. Once you have collected about 10 qt. (9.5 L), add roughly half of the malt extract to your brew pot, and let the wort dissolve it. Once the extract is completely dissolved, hold the temperature near 150°F (66°C) as you collect the rest of the wort. Add about 2 qt. (1.9 L) of water to the brew pot to yield about 3.5 gal. (13.3 L) when you’re done collecting the wort.
Bring wort to a boil. If hot break does not appear big and fluffy after 5 minutes, add 0.5 tsp. calcium chloride. Add the bittering hops and boil wort for an additional 55 minutes. Add Irish moss with 20 minutes left in the boil. Don’t let boil volume dip below 3 gal. (11.4 L) during boil. Add boiling water to top up, if needed. Stir in the remaining malt extract in the last 10 minutes of the boil.
Chill wort to 68°F (20°C), rack wort to a fermenter, and add water to yield about 5 gal. (18.9 L). Aerate the wort thoroughly and pitch sediment from the decanted yeast starter. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). After fermentation stops, rack to a secondary fermenter and hold for three days. Fine with PVPP for clarity, if desired (see below), before racking beer to keg or bottling bucket. Carbonate to 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) of CO₂.
FOR CLEARER BEER (OPTIONAL):
After fermentation and conditioning, dissolve 8 g PVPP in roughly 2 fl. oz. (60 mL) of hot water and gently stir into top layer of beer. Let settle overnight, then rack beer to keg or bottling bucket.",

Chris Colby shares this homebrew recipe for a strong dark ale with a moderately roasty character. It is reasonably dry considering its high original gravity, and the malt, hops, alcohol, and roast character are all in balance. It is meant to seem like an English ale, but it is not an attempt to clone any commercial brand or mimic any classic beer style. For best results, make an appropriately sized yeast starter so you are pitching actively fermenting yeast, and hold the fermentation temperature as constant as you can manage. If you can’t find fresh Goldings, feel free to use any other English hop variety you like.","Ingredients:

Big Brew 2023: Old school rules!
We homebrewers are a promiscuous lot, pushing boundaries and trying new fermentations that are adventurous, unique, and sometimes even wacky. We scan the aisles for inspiration and come up with unique beverages. Some of us never attempt to brew the same recipe twice, and that’s OK.
When I started brewing almost 30 years ago, a friend suggested that I should clone a beer I loved several times until I could repeat it faithfully. This began my initial quest to clone Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale (SNPA), which in turn begot my Nearly Nirvana Pale Ale (NNPA.)
More than 40 years ago, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. set out to create a new American style, the American pale ale. Once considered crazy hoppy, it fortunately wasn’t too far ahead of its time. Ken Grossman, founder of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., states that “after 42 years Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (SNPA) still resonates as a favorite with brewers and drinkers at all levels. Pale Ale started out in 1980 as an anomaly in a world dominated by light lagers with a hop-forward yet balanced style. After all these years it still holds its own in a world now accustomed to a nearly limitless range of hop-forward styles, many that can trace their roots back to the original Sierra Pale Ale.”
In 2000, a call went out to AHA members for an SNPA homebrew recipe and my Nearly Nirvana Pale Ale (NNPA) was shared with the community for that year’s Big Brew recipe. So why bring back this one for Big Brew 2023? Read on and learn…
Oscar Wilde once said that “consistency is the hallmark of the unimaginative.” I counter this philosophy and believe that to master brewing, one must start with a thorough understanding of one’s processes, systems, and ingredients, as well as one’s own limitations to achieve the desired outcomes.
I have brewed my NNPA more than 90 times because my friends and I love it. With my multiple iterations, I began a journey of discovery, tweaking the recipe one variable at a time to understand the impact. Change a mash temperature here, base or specialty grain there, water-to-grain ratio, yeast strain or amount, fermentation temperatures, and so on. By keeping all but one variable the same, I was able to truly understand its impact.
Along with NNPA’s deliciousness, its beauty lies in its simplicity. My current iteration of NNPA is a tad more malt and hop forward than SNPA, and just a skosh bigger. The recipe has been tweaked many times over the years, but my current iteration is, to me, Goldilocks—just right. 
The Homebrew Recipe
Two grains, one hop varietal, and single infusion: easy peasy! Start with fresh American pale malt, add a touch of crystal 40, and mash in at around 156–158°F (69–70°C) to obtain that malt balance. Add an ounce of Cascade whole hops (hey, we are talking old school here) at 75, 60, 15, and 5 minutes before the end of the boil. Add your favorite American ale yeast strain. After a couple of weeks, enjoy. Something not up to what you seek? Examine your process, ingredients, and system and try again, tweaking one variable at a time.
I state that one needs 11.5 pounds of grain for a 5-gallon batch to achieve an original gravity of 1.060. This is, of course, based on one’s system efficiency. Mine gets 72 percent. This is another teachable point about knowing your system. Do you consistently add 1.25 quarts per of grain? Or perhaps 1.5? I prefer closer to 1.5 and only use less water per pound of grains when trying to stuff a large amount of grain into my mash for a barleywine, Belgian tripel, or other high-gravity beer. Your mileage may vary.
Similarly, I suggest 4 ounces of whole Cascade hops at various times for this recipe. The most recent cones I obtained were 5.5% alpha acids, but I have seen Cascade pellets with more than 8%. I am targeting mid-40 IBUs, with the bulk of these in the bittering additions. I also suggest boiling for 75 minutes with additions at 75 and 60 minutes. Time is never an issue when I brew, but there is no reason you couldn’t add them together at 60 minutes. And if you want to lower the bitterness, just add one ounce at 60 minutes and skip the 75-minute addition. When I started brewing, well, sonny, we didn’t know about whirlpool hops (old fogy mode off), so feel free to add that last ounce of hops to your whirlpool if you like.
The point is if you are going to try a recipe multiple times, be consistent with your process. Stick to your standard operating procedure before you go changing anything; after you have developed it into something repeatable and it has virtually become muscle memory, you can tweak it as you like. Hey, you are taking careful notes, aren’t you?
Water is an intimidating subject, and several excellent water calculators are available. If you don’t have an analysis of your water supply, suggesting water additions is somewhat meaningless. Early on someone suggested adding a teaspoon of gypsum (calcium sulfate) to the boil for 5 gallons of hoppy pale ale. This dries the finish, accentuates the bitterness, and tamps down harshness and other benefits, so I do this at a minimum, but my water sources have typically been very soft.
I have used a variety of American and English ale yeasts over the years, but I find a neutral American ale yeast works best—for me. I have brewed split batches to try two or three different yeast strains to understand their differences. Splitting a batch is easy and ensures all other variables are consistent.
If you are like many adventurous homebrewers who veer toward the untried, the unique, the one-off, I applaud your daring, your audacity, and your courage. If you brew without a fully formed recipe in your mind and just wing it, ask yourself if you could brew this masterpiece again if you wanted to. Or have you had your share of messterpieces?
I urge you to consider selecting an easy recipe for a beer style you love. By selecting a proven craft beer that you spend your hard-earned shekels on, or a homebrew recipe that you love, you can enjoy the fruits of your labor while you tinker and learn. Find your recipe, nail it down, and then play with a single variable. You then become viscerally aware of the impact that one variable makes. We can read all we like about ingredients and processes, but by experiencing the entirety of the aromas, flavors, and other dynamics of your finished brew that a single change makes, you are on the road to becoming a better brewer.

Once the extract is dissolved, bring the liquid to a boil. Follow the hop addition schedule listed in the ingredients. Note that the timing of hops is from the end of the boil. Ex: This recipe calls for a 60-minute boil, so the 60-minute addition of hops are added as soon as the boil begins.
After 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add in the 0-minute hop addition. Chill your wort down below 70° F (21° C), transfer to a fermenter, and pitch the yeast. Ferment in the temperature range called for by the yeast you use.
When fermentation is complete (typically ~2 weeks), bottle condition using the corn sugar listed in the ingredients to “bottle condition” (carbonate) your beer. After another ~2 weeks in bottles, you’re good to taste your homebrew!
*Note: this recipe aims to produce ~1.5 gallons of wort at the end of the boil. Depending on your heat source, you will need to start with more water or top up in the fermenter!

8,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/star-gazer-hazy-double-ipa-big-brew-2021/,Not Found,"This hazy double IPA was formulated to showcase the tropical and juicy aromas from BSG Hops’ Zamba™ blend and the minty and green-apple aroma notes from German Polaris hops. The grist is typical for the style, with a little boost from sucrose to increase wort gravity without adding non-fermentables or additional malt flavor. The hopping schedule and yeast strain are intended to set the stage for aroma retention and biotransformation while keeping hop bitterness in check.
Recipe creator Ashton Lewis says, “The name is also a bit odd and was inspired by the recent Great Conjunction and the use of North Star Pils ™ malt and Polaris (a.k.a. the North Star) hops.”

Dark Inception Imperial Porter was contributed by Marcus Baskerville of San Antonio’s Weathered Souls Brewing Co., and the leading force behind the Black Is Beautiful collaborative brewing project.
This recipe was inspired by 2013 AHA Homebrewer of the Year Annie Johnson. Seeing an African American woman win Homebrewer of the Year provided Marcus with a bright hope for his future in homebrewing and inspired his love of brewing big dark beers.
Dark Inception Imperial Porter is a thick-bodied, flavorful beer that features additions of raspberry, cacao, and vanilla, and is bursting with notes of toffee, caramel, coffee, chocolate, malt, liqueur, and fruit. It’s a perfect pairing with rich desserts or as a standalone finale for your evening.

2 Liters Boiron Raspberry Puree
7.8 oz (221 g) Cacao Nibs
2 Madagascar Vanilla Beans to be soaked in Bourbon for 1 week (or 2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract)
1 Tbsp Fermax Yeast Nutrient (optional if your yeast is fresh)

Original Gravity: 1.085 (20.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.023 (5.83°P)
ABV: 8.4%
IBU: 20
SRM: 40","Directions:
Bring 1 gallon (3.8L) of water to 175°F (80°C). Place grains in a strainer bag, and add to water, making sure that they are completely saturated. Steep grain for 30 minutes at approximately 165°F (74°C), stirring occasionally. Remove, rinse, and top off kettle to your normal boil volume.
Stir in the 4 lbs of DME, making sure that it is completely dissolved, then bring to a boil. Total boil time will be 60-90 minutes (depending on desired level of caramelization and desired OG). 30 minutes after reaching boil, add the 60-minute hop addition.
With 15 minutes of the boil remaining, turn off burner. Stir in the 6.6 lbs of LME, 1 lb Maltodextrin, and 1½ tsp Yeast Nutrient, ensuring that they are completely dissolved before turning burner back on. Once having reached boil again, add second hop addition and complete the final 15 minutes of boil.
Chill to 70°F (21°C). Transfer to fermenter, top off volume with water if necessary, and sprinkle yeast directly into wort.
Fermentation Steps:
Once you’ve pitched the yeast, you can create the vanilla bean tincture. Slice the two vanilla beans lengthwise, and place in a pint-sized canning jar. Add 1 cup (235 ml) of your preferred bourbon. Seal jar, set aside, and allow the beans to macerate (soak) for at least a week, shaking jar occasionally. The vanilla beans will be added to the fermenter 1 week before packaging (2 Tbsp of Pure Vanilla Extract can be substituted in place of the vanilla beans just before bottling or kegging).
Ferment at 64-72°F (18-22°C) for 14-21 days.
On 6th day of fermentation: Add 1½ tsp Yeast Nutrient, and 2 Liters of fruit puree to your fermenter. Gently swirl fermenter, if possible, to rouse yeast.
1 week before kegging or bottling: Pre-heat your oven to 300°F. Line a cookie sheet with foil or parchment paper and spread the cacao nibs out evenly in a single layer. Place sheet on middle rack and bake for 10-12 minutes until aroma is released from cacao. Remove, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Place vanilla beans and cacao nibs in muslin bag, add to fermenter, and infuse for 7 days before packaging (if using vanilla extract add it just before packaging).","All Grain Version
Replace malt extract and specialty grains with:
11.5 lbs Crisp Finest Maris Otter
2.25 lb Weyermann® Munich Type 2 10°L
1.5 lb Simpsons DRC™ Double Roasted Crystal 105-120°L
0.75 lb Simpsons Chocolate Malt 400-500°L
0.25 lb Simpsons Black Malt 550-700°L
0.13 lb Weyermann® Chocolate Wheat Malt 375-450°L
Please note that grain bill is calculated for a brewhouse efficiency of 65%, adjust as needed. Mash at 151°F (66°C) for 75 minutes. Marcus recommends a 180-minute boil for the all-grain version of this recipe, but a 90-minute boil may be sufficient."
10,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/cherry-chica-stout-with-julia-herz/,Not Found,"American Homebrewers Association (AHA) Executive Director Julia Herz shares the story behind her homebrew recipe, Cherry Chica Stout.
What’s the story behind this homebrew recipe?
I constructed Cherry Chica Stout in the 90s with the co-owner of the former What’s Brewing Homebrew Shop in Boulder, Colorado. I walked into the store looking to brew a unique stout with fruit, and co-owner Paul Gatza wrote out this recipe for me. Fun fact: Paul would go on to be AHA Director and is now Senior Vice President of the Brewers Association Professional Division.
I’ve since homebrewed this recipe many times, earning 1st place in 1998 and 2000 in the Hop Barley and the Alers Reggale & Dredhop Competition. The Alers are my Boulder-based homebrew club that AHA Founder Charlie Papazian helped create, so it’s fun to think of this recipe having had contact with so many past AHA Directors.
Fast forward to today in 2022. I brewed 7 barrels of Cherry Chica with Shawnee Adelson (Executive Director, Colorado Brewers Guild) and Marni Wahlquist (Head Brewer, Odell Brewing – Sloane Lake). It will be served at the Colorado Brewer’s Guild Collaboration Fest (April 2nd) and Odell’s Sloan Lake location.
Getting to brew this stout recipe on a pro system was a dream for this homebrewer!
What can homebrewers expect from the finished beer?
This beer has notes of roast, medium-low bitter, medium-high tannins that bring some grip, medium body, and a tart puckering sour pie cherry punch. Considering the 7% (estimated) ABV, it drinks relatively light, with the carbonation helping dry out the beer finish. I particularly love the tan collar of foam from the roasted barley and the dark, opaque nature of the beer’s color, with rust-colored hues.
If you find the beer is too tart for your liking, dropping a maraschino cherry into the glass of a fresh pour can work wonders. I now brew this stout recipe with 7-8 pounds of cherries, down from 10 pounds of the original recipe.
Please homebrew this beer, and you are guaranteed to impress when pairing this cherry stout with crumbled blue cheese and raspberry preserves on rice crackers. Duck with cherry sauce and cherry cheesecake are other all-star pairings.","Ingredients:

Why did you pick this homebrew recipe?
My husband, Matt, and I got into homebrewing in 2007. We bought Brewing Classic Stylesbased on the recommendation from the American Brewmaster homebrew shop, which helped us brew a few solid batches of extract beer.
I was still learning about beer and styles, so when I picked my first recipe, I based it on what I knew I liked at the time: wheat beers, Belgian-style whites, etc. In reading the book’s description of the saison recipe, I thought, “sure, why not!”
The finished product was delicious. I was sold on saison.
I remember it being refreshing, with flavors I had never experienced. There was a touch of spice balanced sweet. And it definitely was not like those offensive IPAs I had no desire for (at the time!).
This saison recipe made me fall in love with brewing, homebrewing, and beer.
Tell us about your homebrew club!
After relocating from North Carolina to beautiful Longmont, Colorado, I needed a way to make some new friends. I discovered Left Hand Brewing’s (Longmont, CO) Ales4Females program and went to a talk in December 2013 on beer tasting. The speaker–BJCP exam director Don Blake–mentioned he was a member of Longmont’s Indian Peak Alers homebrew club. My husband and I went to our first meeting in January 2014 and haven’t looked back since! Our homebrew club members are some of our dearest friends, becoming our family away from family.
I also brought my love of organizing and process improvement to the homebrew club. In 2016 I was elected Treasurer and ran our club’s annual homebrew competition, Peak-to-Peak Pro-Am. As I attended more events in the beer community, I looked for more opportunities to talk about beer, homebrewing, and our club. This love for community, connection, and diversity helped get me elected as Vice President of the Indian Peak Alers and then again in 2022 for 2 more years.
I am currently working on a project for Ales4Females where I interview women in the brewing industry in our club’s area of Boulder County to help advocate for more diversity in brewing. I want to make beer and brewing approachable to women and other marginalized folks.
Did we hear you have a portable brew rig?
Yes! I like to advocate that anyone can make beer at home. To help with this, I built a portable, brew-in-a-bag setup that I can take anywhere and brew. I just need access to freshwater!
I started doing homebrewing demonstrations at Longmont’s annual Oktoberfest to show how easy it is. If this little 5-foot tall woman can shlep all this equipment around and make beer under poor weather conditions (sometimes in the rain), anyone can do it!
The system comprises a converted keg, banjo burner, two 6-gallon buckets (one for fermentation), and a 50-foot copper immersion chiller. It all fits nicely into a wagon for easy transport from my vehicle to the demonstration site.
We still haven’t gotten our home brewery and walk-in cooler rebuilt in our new house, but I hope to host an inclusive brew day event with other marginalized folks in a driveway or patio soon!","Ingredients:

A well-known beer style throughout history sometimes called an ‘English mild,’ the Dark Mild is typically low in alcohol while still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts. Expect roasty nuttiness with slight toffee notes perfect for the colder months. This recipe is a ripe example of the difference specialty malts can make.

Mark Pasquinelli shares the following about his beer recipe Mad About Saison:
My first stop [on my saison journey] was the world of Funky Town. I killed two birds with one stone on this recipe, getting out of the same-old-yeast rut and brewing something more sessionable than my usual 7.5% ABV saisons. I used a yeast blend made by Michael Tonsmeire, aka the Mad Fermentationist, that’s distributed through Bootleg Biology.
Tonsmeire mentioned that his yeast packs might swell during storage and not to be alarmed. His blend consists of saison yeast, wild Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, and an opportunistic Lactobacillus culture. At low temperatures, his blend is clean, while traditional saison temperatures bring out flavors of citrus, pepper, and clove.
The blend’s two pair well with fruity and tropical hops, so I did a hop stand and dry-hopped with Galaxy. As advertised, Galaxy’s repertoire of citrus, passion fruit, and grass nicely complement Tonsmeire’s yeast blend, mixing with its tart, crisp, citrus notes. The subsequent creation, Mad About Saison, was a big hit at two homebrew club meetings and became a personal after-dinner staple.","Ingredients:

My journey into homebrewing and the desire for different styles of beer started in the late 1970s. During a trip to Canada, I developed a liking for the draught version of Guinness that was brewed there and distributed widely.
Back home, my search for “different” beers mostly centered around trying regional lagers that were not distributed in our area. The fabled desire for Coors was epic, as it wasn’t to be found in Iowa. Our glee when Olympia and Stroh’s began local distribution! The brief fascination with malt liquor!
The occasional Harp, Heineken, and Carlsberg did offer some variation to the standard American lager fare. One could find other German imports if you were willing to pay the price and withstand the skunk associated with those products.
My real awakening with craft beer began with the opening of Front Street Brewery in Davenport, Iowa, in 1993. Their Raging River was my first experience with pale ale, and it was an eye opener for my beginning to understand the diverse styles of beer that existed in the world. Still, finding those styles in Davenport was limited.
I had heard that one could buy kits and make some of these different styles of beer at home, and I mentioned to my first wife that I was going to explore brewing beer. She beat me to it and surprised me with equipment and an ingredient kit for Christmas.
My early homebrews were stouts, brown ales, ambers, and reds. My second year, I brewed a pale ale. Around that time, I attended a live music event in downtown Rock Island, Ill., which is across the Mississippi River from Davenport. The usual suspect lagers were for sale on the plaza, so I ventured into Rock Island Brewing Co., which is not a brewery, but a pub and eatery named after a historical brewery in Rock Island.
The bartender, John Hovarth (who still pours beers at Radicle Effect Brewerks in Rock Island), commanded multiple taps, many of which poured craft beers from around the country that weren’t available in local stores. One he suggested was Bell’s Oberon. I asked about the style and was dumbfounded when he told me it was a wheat beer. My ignorance of beer styles was evident when I said, “I didn’t know they made beer from wheat.”
As the years passed, I tried my hand at crafting hefeweizen, dunkelweizen, and my favorite style, witbier, which I have brewed multiple times. In 2017, I brewed my first American wheat beer. Simple and straightforward, Summer Wheat has become my go-to summer beer.","Ingredients:

The following is an excerpt from the Zymurgy magazine article Brewing with Food: Oddities in the Mash Tun by Jonny Lieberman:
“Fellow [BeerAdvocate user] Neal Gauger from Philadelphia got in touch with me because he was coming to Los Angeles and wanted to collaborate on an East Coast meets West Coast beer. The West Coast part was easy: big and hoppy. But what to do about the East Coast angle? Specifically Philadelphia. Cheese steak? After some back and forth, Neal suggested Philly pretzels. A good choice, as they are mostly wheat and, compared to other pretzels, lightly salted. The only thing that troubled me is that Philly pretzels get soaked in lye prior to baking. Neal assured me it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“Since the pretzels had been baked, the starches would already be gelatinized. However, most of the starch would be inside the pretzels and protected from the enzymes by the hard outer crust. So, we tore 5 pounds of pretzels into little chunks. Unlike the pumpkin beer, where for whatever reason I was not worried about the stuck mash, I was worried about one with all those goopy pretzels. Because of my foolish pride, I again elected not to use rice hulls. But this time I was nervous. Those pretzels were quite gooey. To get around that, we mashed the beer at a thin 1/5 quarts per pound of grain. When it came time for the runoff, not only was it sooth and trouble free, but we achieved 83-percent efficiency. The final beer weighed in at 1.107 OG with an IBU load of 77.1. Flavor-wise, the pretzels contributed a fruity phenol similar to strawberries that was detected by some. All in all it was a very potent—and quaffable—DIPA (Double IPA).”","Ingredients:

Janet’s Brown Ale has quite the pedigree. Mike “Tasty” McDole took home a medal when this recipe won gold in the Brown Ale category in the National Homebrew Competition (NHC) in 2004. The award-winning recipe was then featured in Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer’s book, Brewing Classic Styles, as an example of a bigger, hoppier American Brown Ale. In 2009, McDole took gold again at the NHC with an updated recipe that he categorized as Imperial Brown Ale, but this time in the Specialty Beers category. Though Janet’s Brown Ale deviates a bit from the style guidelines for a traditional American Brown Ale, surely you will not be upset by the higher IBUs and ABV after taking a sip!

Top up your brew kettle to 3 gallons and bring to a rolling boil (If possible, top up to 6 gallons and conduct a full boil). Stir in the malt extracts and bring kettle to a rolling boil. Add 2.9 oz of Lublin hops and allow to boil for the full 60 minutes. Be careful when adding hops as you may encounter a boil over during the first hop addition. With 15 minutes left in the boil add 1.0 oz of Lublin hops. Allow the wort to cool and then pitch the yeast around 53°F (12°C). Ferment around 53°F (12°C). When fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes of CO2.","All-Grain Option
Replace the Pilsener extract with 7 lb (3.17 kg) continental Pilsener malt. Replace the Munich extract with 12 lb (5.44 kg) Munich Malt. Mash at 150°F (66°C). Increase the pre-boil volume as needed to allow a 90 minute boil, which helps reduce DMS in the beer."

Danny Kiranos, aka Amigo the Devil, is a brewer by day and musician by night. From the Zymurgy magazine article:
Many of his homebrew creations, like the tobacco beer, are inspired by food and his culinary background. One of his all-time favorite homebrewers has been his Avacado Saison. ""I was really worried about the oil content, and I thought it would completely mess with the residuals,"" he says. He opted to cube the avocado, which was not too ripe and still pretty solid, smashing it ever so slightly. ""I figured that way the fat content wouldn't be so heavy,"" he explains. ""It just ferments out, and it dries out the beer a lot,"" he says. The result is an earthy, dry saison he loves.

They were a very new brewery at the time, so I also wanted to make something that would sell quickly. I decided to make something sour but not too crazy. So, I went home, brewed a kettle sour with wheat, and split it three ways to test different fruit additions.

Mash at 152° F (67° C) for one hour and sparge at room temperature. Once the temperature of the wort reaches 120° F (49° C), add the unmilled 2-row to inoculate with Lactobacillus. The original recipe calls for 3 days in an electric smoker at 120° F (49°C), but I leave it at room temperature (average of 85° F (29° C)) for 7-10 days. When the pH reaches 3.1-3.3, add the hops and boil wort for 15 minutes. Cool wort, transfer to a clean, sanitized carboy, and add hydrated yeast and raspberries. Leave the fruit for 4-6 weeks, depending on the color and level of activity. Prime with the table sugar, targeting 3 volumes of CO2. It usually carbonates in two weeks. Chill, pour and enjoy.","Partial-Mash Version

Will Cass started brewing in 2000 when he stumbled upon a Mr. Beer kit. Twenty years later Cass earned the Best of Show title at the 25th annual War of the Worts (2020), the Pennsylvannia-based competition organized by the Keystone Hops Homebrew Club in Montgomeryille, PA.
Cass share’s the following about his Solstice Stout recipe:
“I decided to make an American Stout last year as my December-to-January dark beer, since its dark, roasty, and chocolate notes pair well with all the holiday treats that infiltrate our home… I modeled the sensory profile after the description on a package of high-end coffee beans–highlight the roast, but with enough hop bitterness and citrus notes to complement and make sure it stays in the American stout realm.”

One-Ply Rye is based on an American IPA I’ve been brewing for a few years, but it’s a great one to brew now because the ingredients are so easily swapped to accommodate whatever you have on hand. No rye malt? Use more barley malt or sub in some wheat or oats. Caramel rye malt is readily replaced with any caramel malt in the 30–40°L range. And the world is your oyster when it comes to hops. When I first started brewing this, Amarillo hops were somewhat hard to come by, but they’re easy to get these days. I like the simplicity of dry yeast in a beer like this, but by all means, use what you’ve got.","Ingredients:

Homebrew Con was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead, Pangaea Proxima Polar IPA was selected as the 2020 Big Brew recipe, given that homebrewers from all over the globe would be brewing on May 2 and the recipe features ingredients from the Nothern and Souther Hemispheres.
“We want to use ingredients from all over the world to brew this beer. We decided to use the kveik yeast because what a dream that is for a homebrewer,” said Bailey Spaulding, who is a co-founder of Jackalope and will deliver the Keynote Address at Homebrew Con. “Then we landed on using New Zealand hops for the beer,” she continued, “so the yeast is from an area of the world near the North Pole, and the hops are from an area near the South Pole.”
The beer is named after Pangaea Proxima, which is a theorized future supercontinent that would form 300 million years in the future. “We thought it fit the idea well. Also, we really like the idea of bringing people from around the world together in a time when we are all so separate.”

Most of the hops we use for brewing are of the variety Humulus lupulus var. lupulus, but strains of H. lupulus var. neomexicanus, Medusa, has appeared in at least two commercial beers: Sierra Nevada's Harvest Wild Hop IPA and Crazy Mountain Brewing Company's Neomexicanus Native Pale Ale. And the experimental variety HBC 438, now known as Sabro, was made available to homebrewers in 2014.
Stone-Faced IPA is built around Medusa, but any variety of neomexicanus should work just as well and may be easier to source, Sabro in particular. The monks of the Benedictine Monastery of Christ in the Desert in New Mexico grow five other varieties—Chama, Latir, Tierra, Amalia, and Mintras—which have sold out quickly in the past, but more and more farms are devoting acreage to these uniquely North American varieties.","Ingredients:

Mill the malt and dough in, targeting a mash thickness of around 1.5 qt./lb., a temperature of 154°F (68°C), and a mash pH of 5.4. Hold the mash at 154°F (68°C) for one hour. Sparge slowly with 170°F (77°C) water and collect wort until the pre-boil volume is around 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Adjust this volume as needed to account for your boil-off rate. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first addition at the beginning of boil and the rest at 10 and 0 minutes before the end. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort to 50°F (10°C), aerate thoroughly, and pitch yeast. Ferment at around 50°F (10°C). With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in 2 weeks or less, but don’t rush it (cold-fermented lagers take longer than ales). If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation by raising fermentation temperature to around 60°F (16°C). Rack the beer to a secondary and lager for around 6 weeks. It was not common practice for brewers ca. 1900 to dry hop their lagers, but if desired, Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops could be added to secondary during lagering for additional noble hop aroma: 1 oz. (28 g) should be sufficient. Bottle or keg after lagering is complete.","Extract Version
Replace the malts with 7 lb. William’s Brewing American Lager liquid malt extract. Omit water salts. Dissolve extract in enough hot reverse osmosis or distilled water to yield a pre-boil volume of around 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Adjust this volume as needed to account for your boil-off rate. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.
Boil 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. The other hop additions are 10 and 0 minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill, pitch, and ferment as above."

The following homebrew recipe comes courtesy of Jared Hatch. Hatch designed this IPA to make use of some of the citrus fruits native to Korea.
As an avid cook, Hatch enjoys applying things he learns from the culinary world to his brewing. To extract the citrus flavors from the fruit without adding unwanted astringency and vegetal matter, he peeled 20 green tangerines from Jeju (an island off the south coast of Korea), put them in a zip-top bag with dextrose, and removed the air to keep the peels in close contact with the sugar to produce an “oleo-saccharum.” The peels dissolve the sugar and lend their essential oils in the process to yield a syrup that can be added to the boil kettle at knockout.","Ingredients:

A London porter benefits from the proper water: alkaline with a dose of sodium and chloride. Thames water was revered as producing better porters and that character is evidenced in the water profile. The somewhat elevated alkalinity of the London porter profile helps keep the mash pH slightly higher than in typical pale beer brewing, enhancing the flavor quality of the dark malts.
A London porter would likely be characterized as a brown porter using BJCP style guidelines. The malt bill for a brown porter is largely 2-row pale malt with modest percentages of roast and crystal malts. According to Brewing Classic Styles, the secret to a great brown porter recipe is the inclusion of brown malt. English hops are preferred to meld with the malt bill.","Ingredients:

A mashout step to 168° F (76° C) is helpful, but optional. Sparge the mash with low-alkalinity water that is acidified to a pH between 5.4 and 5.7. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Use a program such as Bru’n Water to guide the mineral additions needed to produce the London porter brewing liquor.

Many English hop varieties can be substituted. London Ale yeast is preferred for its minerally character and fruity ester profile. However, the English or U.S. ale yeasts may be substituted.","Extract Version

The recipe calls for a 25-hour boil. That’s right: 25 hours. You’ve been warned. Note that Lubelski hops also go by the names Lublin and Lubelska; Saaz is a good substitute if you can’t get them. If you cannot source Lomik hops, Northern Brewer will work well. We haven’t even attempted to calculate color or bitterness for this beast of a beer.
CAUTION! It is impossible to know what molds, yeasts, and bacteria will grow in spontaneously fermented wort. Consuming traditionally brewed jopen beer carries some element of risk. Proceed with caution.

During this last rest pull a 3-liter decoction, add the hops, and boil for 30 minutes. Combine decoction and mash, heat to 77°C (171°F), vorlauf, and lauter. Heat collected wort to 85°C (185°F) and start whirlpool. Cool to 18–20°C (64–68°F) and run off into fermenter. Fermentation: Add 10% old Berliner weisse (pH < 3.5, minimum 2 months old) in fermenter; if not available, pre-acidify wort with lactic acid to a pH of 4.1–4.3. Pitch 19 mL of thick slurry from the mixed culture. Activate the yeast slurry 12 hours before with starter wort. Ferment at 20–25°C (68-77°F) for 2–3 months or until stable gravity is reached. Bottling: When bottling, use a mixture of old and young beer or, if not possible, priming sugar. Target an additional extract of 1.7°P (7 SG points). The result should be 3.5 vol. (7 g/L) of CO2. The beer should be kept at 18–20°C (64–68°F) for at least 3 weeks to develop the appropriate aroma and carbonation. Sensory Outcomes: In the beginning, the beer tastes and smells slightly lactic—a bit like grainy yogurt—but at around 4–8 weeks develops the typical bouquet of apricot and peaches. Later in bottling, it may develop a minimal funk that often manifests as hay-like aromas.","Extract Version
Due to the decoction mash and mash hopping technique, it is not possible to exactly reproduce this beer using extract. Nonetheless, you can still brew a delightful Berliner weisse by dissolving 4 lb. (1.81 kg) wheat liquid malt extract in hot water and then steeping the hops in the resultant wort for 30 minutes at 93°C (200°F). Chill wort to 18–20°C (64–68°F), transfer to fermenter, and proceed as above."

Erich Purcell, 2019 GABF Pro-Am Competition Bronze Medal, with Ross Koenigs of New Belgium Brewing Co.
Chess with Checkers is something Purcell calls a house beer that he brews fairly regularly. ""I love tripels, but I can't drink them the way I want to drink beer. So, I started pulling the recipe down to try to get it to a more quaffable strength, but still retain that Belgian flavor,"" he says.
He describes it as a Pilsner with a pile of Belgian flavor. ""It still has a hoppiness that you don't see in many belgian beers, but it's backed up by all of the esters an phenols that you do expect,"" he says.
That's exactly what stuck out to Ross Koenigs, research and development brewer at New Belgium Brewing Co., who said it's a beer that every brewer wahts to make and to drink. ""It was bright and crisp and had all the great Belgian character, but supremely drinkable and super well balanced,"" Koenigs says.

Joel Miller, 2019 GABF Pro-Am Competition Silver Medal, with Greg Fleehart of Precarious Beer Project.
Leicht is a beer that appeals to everyone, from the traditionally domestic beer drinkers to craft beer enthusiasts, Miller says. ""It's a beer basically for everybody,"" Miller notes. This could be attributed to the simple recipe with a little bit of body, some bittering hops, overall balance, and low alcohol.
Fleehart describes the beer as similar to a low-alcohol Munich helles, with flavors of a lightly toasted baguette. ""It's a really easy-drinking beer but with tons of flavor and texture,"" Fleehart says. ""The yeast has a really nice ester, more character than your average lager yeast.""

Earlier this year, I joined a great new group of coworkers on Capitol Hill. Within weeks, we had made plans to enter into the Capitol Hill Home-brew Competition, but weren't sure what to brew. In true democratic fashion, we setup to do an extensive tasting of styles to choose one that truly represents the people - or at least the handful of us in the office. While not unanimous, the group enjoyed citrusy new american hops and session strength. The natural choice was obvious - American Pale Ale.
But what to call this concoction? In a stroke of genius, we combined our Florida district connection (Manatees) with our committee assignments (Space) and voila The Majestic Sea Cow - Galaxy Hopped Pale Ale!

Rogue’s Chocolate Stout is smooth, sweet and velvety, and tastes like a chocolate malted milkshake with slight hoppiness and bittersweet chocolate notes.
The allure of this beer comes down to the chocolate flavors, which makes it enjoyable for both the chocolate and beer lover. The sweet, creamy head gives way to a rich chocolate truffle finish. This beer pairs perfectly with desserts as it’s balanced by plenty of roasty flavor and bitterness. We suggest pairing with a chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cream pie or other rich chocolate dessert.

Future Forward Sour Saison is a mixed-fermentation fruit beer inspired by my political engagement to a local Sato brewer in northeastern part of Thailand. Sato is a traditional sticky rice beer using a local yeast ball called Look Pang, which contains mold, mysterious yeast strains, and Lactobacillus, all of which give a nice fruity sour character to the brew.
Due to the hot climate of Thailand, this brew is designed for a high fermentation temperature using mixed yeast strains, saison yeast, and a Sato yeast ball. I also used lychee fruit from the northern hill tribes of Thailand. This recipe embraces the lost art of traditional Thai brewing.
I consider brewing to be an ancient human right. People should be able to make their own beer and bring happiness to share with their community. I am working on the laws here and looking forward to a future in which craft beer can be brewed in Thailand and later exported to the world.","Ingredients:

To prepare sticky rice:
Soak the sticky rice overnight.
Steam rice until cooked, about 15 minutes, then rinse with cool water until rice is cool and no longer sticky.
Mash grains and steamed sticky rice in 8 qt. (7.6 L) of water at 150°F (65.6°C). Collect the wort, top up with water to make 5 gal. (18.9 L), and bring to a boil. Top up to 6 gal. (22.7 L). Turn the heat off, add the malt extract and stir to completely dissolve. Return the wort to the heat and boil 60 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow to cool with the lid off until wort reaches 180°F (82.2°C). Add hops and blended lychee, and let steep 20–30 minutes before fully chilling. Transfer chilled wort to fermenter, aerate, and pitch the saison yeast and Sato yeast ball. Ferment at 73°F (22.8°C) for about two weeks. Add dry hops 7 days before bottling or kegging. * Sticky rice is also known as glutinous rice and can be purchased at any Asian market. Rice yeast balls are more difficult to find but can be ordered online from Amazon and eBay: search for “Chinese dried yeast balls.”",

Recipe courtesy Jackie O’s Pub & Brewery, Athens, Ohio
In May 2007, Art Oestrike’s brother Brian Oestrike summited Mount Everest to raise money for the LUNGevity Foundation, a lung cancer-focused nonprofit. Art and Brian’s mother, Jackie, had passed away from lung cancer on June 14, 2006. As Newcastle Brown Ale was a favorite of Jackie’s (who was born in England), then-brewer Brad Clark created the recipe for Chomolungma as an American interpretation of the British classic. The beer was named for the word Tibetans use for Mount Everest, which means “Goddess Mother of the Earth.” When it came time to choose the core lineup of beers to be released in cans from our production brewery in 2012–2013, this meant-to-be-one-off beer had become the third-best seller at our brewpub. It was first packaged in cans in May 2013 and has been a favorite of customers and staff alike ever since.","Ingredients:

Recipe by Roel Mulder
This traditional Dutch beer style was one of the many pleasant finds during my search for lost beer recipes. Its malty profile and unusual blend of spices make for a unique beer. Originally, it was made from 100 percent diastatic brown malt. To be on the safe side, I used a 50/50 blend of Munich malt and Pilsner malt here. If your Munich malt is light enough, and has enough diastatic power, you could try a 100 percent Munich malt grist.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4 lb. (1.81 kg) Munich malt
4 lb. (1.81 kg) Pilsner malt
HOPS
1.4 oz. (39 g) Hallertau (or similar) 4% a.a. @ 60 min
YEAST
2 sachets Fermentis SafAle S-33 or similar
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
0.9 oz. (26 g) crushed coriander seed @ 15 min
0.9 oz. (26 g) orange peel @ 15 min
0.9 oz. (26 g) licorice root @ 15 min
Specifications:
Yield: 4.89 gallons (18.5 L)
Original Gravity: 1.042 (10.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.010 (2.6°P)
ABV: 4% by volume
IBU: 40
SRM: 8.6
Efficiency: 70%","Directions:
Mash at 152°F (66.7°C) for 60 minutes or until an iodine starch test indicates full conversion. (If you opt for 100 percent Munich malt, the lower diastatic power compared to other base malts may require extra time to complete saccharification.) Lauter, sparge, and collect wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops, coriander, orange peel, and licorice root as indicated. Chill to 63°F (17.2°C), pitch yeast, and ferment at that temperature until specific gravity stabilizes at or near 1.010 (2.6°P). Bottle or keg with 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) CO2. This beer should be ready to enjoy four weeks after brew day.","Extract Version
Replace malts with 5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Dissolve extract completely in warm reverse osmosis water and proceed with the boil."

Recipe by Bjørne Røthe, adapted by Stan Hieronymus and the editors of Zymurgy
Bjørne’s original recipe was for 120 liters (31.7 US gal.), which is a full US barrel and a bit more than most North American homebrewers can comfortably produce. We have scaled Bjørne’s recipe down to a more manageable volume and estimated the vital stats.","Ingredients:
MALTS
11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) pale malt
11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) Pilsner malt
HOPS
3 oz. (85 g) East Kent Golding or Northern Brewer at start of boil
YEAST
Kveik #2 Rivenes preferred but not commonly available. A good substitute is Kveik #1 Sigmund’s Voss, available as Omega Yeast Labs OYL-061 Voss Kveik, The Yeast Bay Sigmund’s Voss Kveik, East Coast Yeast ECY43 Nordic Farmhouse, and Inland Island Yeast INIS-441 Norwegian Farmhouse
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
Juniper branches (try to find Juniperus communis)
Specifications:
Yield: 6.6 US gallons (25 L)
Original Gravity: 1.097 (23.1°P), estimated
Final Gravity: 1.020 (5.1°P), estimated
ABV: 10.4% by volume
SRM: 7","Directions:
Heat juniper infusion in the kettle. Pour it on the malts. Add new water to the kettle (leaving the same juniper there), then heat that. This is the sparge water. (When Bjørne runs off wort, he tops up with this thinner infusion.) The lauter filter is juniper branches. You want only the tips, no berries, for both the infusion and the sparge water. The mash liquor is 158°F (70°C) when Bjørne starts ladling it onto the mash, and 167°F (75°C) at the end, because the fire heats the infusion while he ladles it on. The temperature of the mash is not known. Mash one hour, then lauter very slowly, about half an hour for the 25-liter batch. Boil for 6 to 7 hours, until 6.6 gal. (25 L) remain. It’s not clear how much wort there is before the boil begins because it starts immediately when there is enough wort to cover the bottom. Add hops when boil begins. Cool wort to 99°F (37°C) and pitch kveik yeast. The fermenter is insulated so the beer will stay warm during fermentation. Ferment 3 days. Bjørne does not measure original or final gravity. Sigmund Gjernes uses about the same process, but less malt. Bjørne uses 420 g of malt per liter, while Sigmund uses 333 g. Sigmund’s beer is roughly 8.5%, so this beer is probably 10–11% ABV.","Extract Version
Use 9 lb. (4.08 kg) pale liquid malt extract and 9 lb. (4.08 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract in place of the malted grains. Dissolve extracts with hot juniper-infused water to a volume of 6.6 gal. (25 L) and boil 15 minutes to sterilize. Cool and pitch as above."

Efficiency: 84%","Directions:
Mash 2 qt./lb. at 149°F (65°C) for 90 minutes. Add ULTRA-FERM at the start of mash. The low mash temperature, enzyme, and rice really help dry out the beer. Target 5.2 mash pH. Increase to 168°F (76°C) for mash out and sparge. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at 60 and 30 minutes. Chill to 50°F (10°C), oxygenate well, and pitch yeast starter. Ferment at 51°F (11°C) for 7–10 days. Let free rise to 62°F (17°C) for 5 days, then slowly cool to 32°F (0°C) over the next week. We are fanatical about limiting cold-side oxidation and use CO2-filled Mylar balloons to prevent airlock suck-back while chilling. (Thank you to Marshall at Brülosohphy for the balloon idea.) Closed-pressure transfer to CO2-purged kegs and force carbonate to 2.8 vol. (5.6 g/L) CO2. Lager for at least 3 weeks. Clean, sanitize, repeat. Cheers!","EXTRACT VERSION
Substitute 7.5 lb. (3.4 kg) extra-light dry malt extract for pale two-row malt. Substitute 2 lb. (907 g) rice extract syrup for flaked rice. Dissolve sugar and extracts completely in RO water, then top off to desired boil volume. Proceed as above. Color will be slightly darker than all-grain recipe (3 SRM)."

In the 1970s, Munich Breweries like Paulaner began to notice that paler versions of their Oktoberfestbier were selling better than the classic, full-bodied, copper-colored brew. So Paualaner initiated a return to the more Vienna-style Oktoberfest, which was lighter in body and color, in an an attempt to make it still taste great and yet be less filling.The result was festbier, which was adopted in 1990 os Oktoberfest’s official beer.
Festiber provides a wonderful opportunity to fine-tune the balance between malty flavor, clean lager character, crisp though not quite bitter noble hop accents, and drinkability.","Ingredients:

Hold at that temperature for 60 minutes. Apply heat or boiling water to mash out at 168°F (76° C) for 10 minutes. Sparge, boil 90 minutes, and add hops at stated intervals. Chill and oxygenate when wort temperature falls below 80° F (27° C). Pitch a strong starter of yeast at 48° F (9° C). Fermentation temperature may be allowed to rise to 50° F (10° C). As fermentation slows, bring to 55° F (13° C) and hold three days for a diacetyl rest.

This recipe courtesy of Amahl Turczyn with updates from Cigar City brewmaster Wayne Wambles.
Cigar City brewmaster Wayne Wambles deemed this recipe “pretty close to classic Jai Alai circa 2009-2010.” He made a few suggestions to bring this recipe closer to the original, including the use of the Thames Valley ale yeast strain, Munich malt in the 6-10*L range, and an updated water profile that “pushes the sulfate up to 150 ppm and the chloride up to 125 ppm. This will jack up the calcium, but we find that quite a bit of it precipitates out.” Many thanks, Wayne!","Ingredients:

Recipe by Chuck Spypeck.
Some readers may recognize Chuck Skypeck as the technical brewing projects manager for the Brewers Association, the AHA’s parent organization. But once upon a time, Chuck served as co-owner and brewmaster at Boscos Restaurant & Brewing Co. in Memphis and Nashville, Tenn., and Little Rock, Ark.
According to Boscos’ website, it was “the first North American brewery regularly making a stone beer, the original being Rauchenfels in Neustadt, Germany. Boscos began brewing Famous Flaming Stone Beer in 1993.”
Of the hot-stone process, Chuck says, “The flavors created, while unique, are subtle. For this reason, all my steinbier formulas minimized extemporaneous and competing flavors. What really worked well was somewhat of a helles recipe.”
Chuck adds, “This formula produced a very drinkable beer that carried the unique caramel flavor created by the stones. It was our number-one-selling beer in all our pubs. We typically sold about 7 barrels a week, week in and week out, all year round.”","Ingredients:

Here's what recipe creator Kurt Elia has to say on Trappist Tripel:
A unique aspect of this recipe is the small yeast starter I add to the bottling bucket. When I have brewed high-alcohol beers in the past, bottle conditioning has been slow. Sometimes it never reached the desired level of carbonation. Tripels are supposed to be nicely effervescent, so I didn’t want to take any chances. This method worked well, and I will make this a regular part of my process for big, bottle-conditioned beers in the future.","Ingredients:

Conduct a single infusion mash for 75 minutes at 149°F (65°C), adjusting strike water with gypsum and lactic acid to achieve a mash pH of 5.4. (I used 1 tsp. gypsum and 3 mL 88% lactic acid solution to achieve this, but your mileage may vary!) Fly sparge with 170°F (76.7°C) water to collect 7.3 gal. (27.6 L) wort. Add white sugar to hot wort, stirring well to avoid scorching, and then boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and Whirlfloc as indicated, to yield 5.75 gal. (21.8 L) wort. Rack to fermenter, chill to 62°F (16.7°C), oxygenate well, and pitch yeast slurry. (Be sure to reserve some yeast for bottling—see below.) Allow the temperature to rise slowly to 70°F (21.1°C) as fermentation progresses over the course of the next 4 to 5 days. If desired, add 10 drops of Fermcap S once the kräusen forms. When fermentation has slowed (about 6 to 7 days into fermentation), allow the temperature to rise to 72°F (22.2°C) and hold it there for another week prior to bottling. Midway through this week, add a solution of Polyclar mixed with 350 mL boiled water, stirring gently to avoid too much oxygenation. The day before bottling, make a mini yeast starter using 1.4 oz. (40 g) dry malt extract in 500 mL water. Do not add hop pellets or Fermcap to the starter, as it will go directly into the bottles. After boiling for 30 minutes, chill the starter to 62°F (16.7°C) and add 10 to 15 mL of thick yeast slurry. Allow starter to grow on a stir plate at room temperature for about 18 hours or until it has reached high kräusen. Rack beer into bottling bucket and measure volume of finished beer. The goal is to add enough priming sugar to provide 3.3 vol. (6.6 g/L) CO2. For 5 gal. of beer at 72°F (22.2°C), this would be about 6.7 oz. (190 g) of corn sugar, but I reduced this to 6 oz. (170 g) to account for unfermented extract in the actively fermenting mini-starter. An even 6 oz. (170 g) worked well for me. Bottle in heavy glass bottles that can handle the high carbonation of this beer, and allow bottles to condition at room temperature for 4 weeks.","Extract Version

Then there’s the anticipation of waking up in the morning and going out to my brew garage… I mash in, set the timer and have breakfast. I’m brewing, the aroma of malt and hops soon fills the air, and I simply love it.”

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 12 quarts (11.5 liters) of 140°F (60°C) water to crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold temperature 132°F (53°C) for 30 minutes. Add 6 quarts (6 liters) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add malt extract, agave extract syrup, and 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and the Irish moss. When one minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (20 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C) and ferment for about 7 to 12 days, or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.  Best if aged for six months or more!",

Single infusion mash option: Include the melanoidin malt and mash at 152°F (67°C) for 90 minutes followed by a 10-minute mash out at 168°F (76°C). Decoction option: Omit melanoidin malt. Mash in at 132°F (56°C) and hold for 10 minutes. Heat mash to 147°F (64°C), and then pull a decoction of 1/3 the total mash volume. Maintain the main mash for an hour at 147°F (64°C). Meanwhile, heat the decoction to 156–158°F (69–70°C), hold for 10 minutes, and then bring to a boil. Boil decoction for 10 minutes and then raise the temperature of the main mash to 156–158°F (69–70°C). Return the decoction to the main mash to achieve a mash-out temperature of 168°F (76°C). Both versions: Add first wort hops to kettle, and then lauter, sparge, and collect enough wort to yield 5 gal. (18.9 L) after a 90-minute boil.

This partial-mash brut IPA by Chris Colby is bursting with tropical fruit notes from New Zealand hop varieties. Any brewer who has made beers using the “extract plus grains” method will have no problem making this beer. The only thing you need beyond the typical extract brewing setup is a 2- or 3-gallon (7.5 to 11.4 liter) beverage cooler and a large nylon sack to hold the grains. For best results, use the freshest malt extract possible and make the 2 qt. (roughly 2 L) yeast starter. If you help the yeast out, it will make a great beer for you.","Ingredients:

Place the crushed malts and flaked maize in a large steeping bag. Heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) of water to 164°F (73.3°C) and pour it into the cooler. Lower the grain bag into the hot water and use a large spoon to stir the mixture. The temperature should settle at around 152°F (66.7°C). Cover and rest the mash for 45 minutes. Stick as closely as possible to the specified volume and temperatures to get the most out of this small mash. In the last 15 minutes, add 3 qt. (2.8 L) of water to your brew kettle and heat it to around 170°F (76.7°C). In addition, before the partial mash finishes, heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) of water to 170°F (76.7°C). Collect the wort from the partial mash by drawing off roughly 2 cups (473 mL) of wort from the spigot. Pour the wort into your brew kettle. Then, add roughly two cups (473 mL) of hot water to the top of the grain bed in the cooler. Repeat until the sparge water is depleted. Then, run off the remaining wort and pour it in your brew kettle. Once the entire wort is collected, stir in half the malt extract and heat the wort to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the bittering hops at the beginning of the boil. Add the Irish moss, yeast nutrients, and the remaining malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Add the whirlpool hops after knockout and let them steep for roughly 10 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill the wort, allowing hops and trub to settle, with the lid on your brew pot, for at least 30 minutes. Rack the wort to a fermenter and add cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. Leave as much trub and hop debris behind in the kettle as is reasonably possible. Aerate the wort well and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). When fermentation has peaked and then slowed down for a few days, add the enzyme. Let the fermentation go to completion, and then add your dry hops to a secondary fermenter and rack the beer onto them. Dry hop for 7–10 days and then bottle or keg.",

The Camp Fire--the most devastating wildfire in California's history--has hit close to home for Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. While the Chico brewery was spared, many of Sierra Nevada's employees, patrons and neighbors lost everything as the Camp Fire ravaged northern Californian.
To help raise much needed support for the recovery efforts, Sierra Nevada has created a beer called Resilience IPA. Sierra Nevada, along with many of its professional brewing peers, will be brewing and selling Resilience IPA with all proceeds donated to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund through Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation.
It is our hope that homebrewers will make a batch of Resilience IPA in solidarity with Sierra Nevada and pro breweries across the country. While we can't sell our creations and donate the proceeds, please consider donating to the Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation if you are able.

Charlie Papazian presents Puna Coast Black Lager, named after the black coast of Hawaii, in the article ""Drinkably Dark: Exploring Black Lager"" featured on page 51 of the Janurary/February 2002 edition of Zymurgy magazine.
The concept of this recipe, and Charlie's article as a whole, is that all dark beers cannot be simplified as heavy and strong. This German-style schwarzbier is an example of a dark beer that is very similar to its sessionable, lighter-colored cousins. In fact, if blindfolded, the color of many well crafted schwarzbiers is often a surprise based on the preconceived notions of what a dark ale ""should taste and smell like."" Just like it is taught on the first day of kindergarten, you can't always judge a book by its cover.","Ingredients:

Add 1 gallon (4 L) additional water, the malt extract syrup and 60 minute hops. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for 50 minutes.
Then add the remaining once ounce of hops and Irish moss.
After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat.
Strain out, sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 1.5 gallons (6 L) of cold water have been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5 gallon (19 L) batch size.
Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C).
When evidence of fermentation is seen, ferment at about 55°F (12.5°C) range for about seven days or until fermentation is complete and appears to clear and darken.
At this point rack (transfer) the beer into a secondary fermenter and lager between 35 and 40°F (2 to 4.5°C) for four to six weeks.

The beer styles that we are familiar with in modern day have, of course, evolved for many years. A few years ago, Alastair Kocho-Williams wrote a piece in Zymurgy magazine about how Soviet beer styles evolved from four standardized Soviet beer groups in 1927 to many styles encompassing dark ales, dark lagers, ""black"" beers, ""caramel"" beers, and much more. This beer was taken from the Soviet-style karamelnoe (""caramel,"" which would be renamed later as barkhatnoe, meaning ""velvet""), which was a low-alcohol beer that was was brewed quickly, sometimes with Lactobacillus as well as yeast, and pasteurized so that it finished with a sweet flavor, syrupy aftertaste, and malty aroma. This style survived the Great Patriotic War of 1941–45, and some still survive to this day.

From AHA founder and recipe creator Charlie Papazian:
""I recently formulated a new beer called Visionary Mild. Its a mild light brown ale brewed with a relatively new type of crystal malt made by Simpsons called Double Roasted Crystal (DRC) malt, 120°L. It's a crystalized caramel malt of a similar genre as Belgian maltster Castle Malting's Special B and U.S. maltster Briess's Roasted Caramel Malts. All of them add a degree of mildly sweet, dark caramel along with raisin, prune, and dried fruit-like complexity to beer.
""Also significant in the recipe is the traditional English brown malt, which lends an unusual toasted, but not sweet, dryness to beers. If you are formulating beers that tend to head in the direction of sweet and fruity, a bit of brown malt has a good counter-balancing effect on the overall impression of drinkability.
""Traditional English hops are used in order to not overshadow the malt character; in other words, I'm not trying to overpower this beer with American citrus and fruity hop character. I personally have access to home cultivated transplanted wild hops, which with late hopping lend a mild protein-like deliciousness to beer (umami). American Crystal hops or UK East Kent Goldings are also good options for dry hopping. Avoid some of the traditional English ale yeast strains that tend to create diacetyl; it will collide with the malt complexity in this beer. American Ale yeast is a cleaner and better option.""","Ingredients:

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 8 quarts (7.6 L) of 140° F (60° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (56° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minutes hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remain, add the 5-minute hops. After the boil is finished, add the whirlpool hops and allow to steep. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gallons (19 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21°C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Extract Option
Substitute the Maris Otter malt with 5 lb. (2.3 kg) of light malt extract syrup or 4.3 lb. (1.95 kg) dry light malt extract. Also consider reducing the whirlpool hop addition to from 1.25 oz. to 1 oz. (28 g). Place crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 155° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain out, rinse with 3 quarts (3 L) of hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add malt extract and 60 minute hops. Bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remain, add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add the steep-after-boiling hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add cold water to achieve a 5.5 gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21°C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping.

Brewers Notes
""There are two keys to brewing this beer. The first is the malt bill. It's fairly complex, and for that reason some patience is required. In my experience, the more complex the grain bill, the more conditioning the beer needs for the flavors to meld. I also recommend sourcing the debittered dark malts to keep the roastiness restrained. The other key is fermentation. The strain of yeast is largely unimportant and can be either lager or ale as long as esters are restrained. I used an ale yeast that ferments cleanly at lower temperatures just because it was available. The recipe is also fairly dry for the style, which is a personal preference, so just look for yeast that ferments cleanly, attenuates well, and can handle the higher ABV.""","Ingredients:

At flameout, wait until wort cools to 180° F (82° C) to avoid volatizing hop oils. Set timer for 40 minutes and add first hop stand addition. After 10 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, add the second and third hop stand additions. After the total hop stand of 40 minutes, chill wort to 67° F (19° C), decant starter, pitch yeast, and aerate. Over the course of the two-week fermentation, ramp the temperature up to 73° F (23° C) to ensure full attenuation. On approximately day five of fermentation, when attenuation has reached about 80 percent, add the first dry hop addition. (Optionally, you could add a can of thawed pineapple or grapefruit juice concentrate at this point.) Five days later, remove the first dry hop addition, add the second addition, and dry hop for five more days. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2 (or add 3.75 oz./106 g corn sugar if bottling) and drink fresh. Prost!","Extract Version

Heat 2 qt. (2 L) water to 172° F (78° C) and then add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155° F (68° C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew. After 45 minutes, add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167° F (75° C). Then pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170° F (77° C) water. Discard the grains. Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gal. (9.5 L). Add dextrose/corn sugar, malt extract, and 60-minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add the 0-minute hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold-water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5 gal. (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (13° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop powder for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks.

Cider generally doesn't contain much in the way of yeast nutrients, so most hard cider recipes call for an addition. However, malted barley wort does contain yeast nutrients, and low-gravity wort ""tailings"" collected after you've finished sparging a high-gravity all-grain beer are easy to com by—just sparge a bit longer once your beer volume has been reached. The extra low-gravity wort provides excellent yeast nutrient for cider fermentation and lends a pleasing body, flavor, and complexity.","Ingredients:
4 gal. (15.1 L) 1.050 gravity apple juice
1 gal. (3.8 L) malted barley wort (preferably 1.040–1.050 gravity)
sweetener (optional, see directions)
2 tsp. (10 mL) cream of tartar
2 12-ounce (355 mL) cans frozen apple (or other fruit) juice concentrate to back-sweeten.
English ale yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5.25 gallons (20 L)
Original Gravity: 1.050 (12° P)
Final Gravity: 1.004–1.006 (1–1.5° P) before backsweetening
ABV: about 6%","Directions:
Boil 1 gallon (3.79 L) wort tailings (see intro for explanation) for at least 15 minutes. If wort is less than 1.050 OG, collect a greater volume and boil until target gravity is reached (or add unhopped malt extract or other sweeteners. Just don’t add hops!). Pour apple juice into a sanitized 6.5-gallon (24.6 L) fermenter, splashing to aerate. Rack wort onto juice, make sure temperature equalizes at about 68° F (20° C), and pitch yeast. Ferment out completely, and then wait until yeast begins to fall out and the cider starts to clarify. Rack off lees into a sanitized keg, backsweeten to taste, force carbonate to desired CO2 level, and chill to serving temperatures of no higher than 40° F (4° C). Note: the final volume at kegging is 5 gallons (18.9 L). It is not recommended to bottle this recipe if doing the backsweetening process. Cream of Tartar For added balance, a modest addition of acidity really helps bring a nice zip to cider made from table apples rather than true cider apples. Most table varieties have high sugar content and only a bit of acidity, with almost no astringency. Fortunately, adding acidity is as easy as blending in one or two teaspoons of cream of tartar, a common baking ingredient. It’s tartaric acid, made from purified grape skin residues, and thus has an astringent character as well. I usually go with two teaspoons (10 mL) boiled in about 1 fluid oz. (30 mL) of water in the microwave to sanitize, and then dissolved into the cider before backsweetening. Backsweetening & Other Sweeteners Personally, I like to maximize the apple component of cider. Apple juice concentrate is my favorite way to backsweeten. Yes, it is highly fermentable, so the fermented, blended cider must be refrigerated, preferably after kegging and force carbonation, but the extra apple flavor and aroma is very appealing if you get the balance right. For a 5-gallon (18.9 L) volume at a finishing gravity of 1.004 to 1.006 (1 to 1.5° P), I blend in just enough frozen apple juice concentrate to bring the gravity up about one point Plato to 1.012 (2.5° P) and then taste. This ends up being about two 12-ounce (355 mL) cans of concentrate, but I always have extra on hand. Remember if you choose to carbonate your cider, that will affect the perception of dryness too. Learn more about backsweetening cider.      ","Extract Option
Dissolve 1.4 lb. (625 g) unhopped extra-pale malt extract syrup or 1.15 lb. (522 g) extra-light dry malt extract and other sweeteners (if desired) into one gallon (3.8 L) of water. Boil 15 minutes to sanitize. Pour apple juice into sanitized, 6.5-gallon (24.6 L) fermenter, splashing to aerate. Rack wort onto juice, make sure temperature equalizes at about 68° F (20° C) and pitch yeast. Ferment out completely, and then wait until yeast begins to fall out and the cider starts to clarify. Rack off lees into a sanitized keg, back-sweeten to taste, force carbonate to desired CO2 level, and chill to serving temperatures of no higher than 40° F (4° C)."

Few beers can be called ""meaty"" in both the figurative and literal senses of the word. Expedition Stout, from Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, Mich., is one. Based on the strong, well hopped ales that England once shipped to the czar's court, Expedition Stout measures between 10 and 11 percent ABV. You don't seek out a beer like this just for the buzz, that's for sure. Expedition Stout goes well with a wide variety of foods, from roasts and steaks to rich chocolate desserts.

12.5 lb. (5.67 kg) two-row malt
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) black malt
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) roasted barley
0.5 lb. (227 g) chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (227 g) flaked barley
4 oz. (113 g) Caramunich malt
4 lb. (1.8 kg) amber malt extract
3 lb. (1.36 kg) dark malt extract
4 oz. (113 g) Centennial hops (45 min.)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Centennial hops (30 min.)

SRM: 81
Boil Time: 90 minutes","Directions:
Mash rest at 150°F (66°C) for 20 minutes, collect wort slowly, and sparge at 170°F (77°C). Add malt extract to filled kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding 4 oz. (113 g) of hops at 45 minutes, 1.5 oz. (42 g) at 30 minutes, and 0.25. oz (7 g) at flameout. Pitch twice the usual amount of HEALTHY yeast cells, and aerate twice as much as normal. Pitch a new, healthy yeast culture to prime at bottling. Prime to reach about 2.3 volumes (4.6 g/L) of CO2. Age for as long as you can wait, ideally at least three to six months. Primary Fermentation: 7–10 days at 72°F (22°C) Secondary Fermentation: 2 days at 55°F (13°C), 7 days at 40°F (4°C) Notes:  The key to success is a healthy, vigorous yeast, asserts Alec Mull, who provided the recipe. “Otherwise, the beer will never go terminal, and the residual starch will make it cloyingly sweet.” For a 5-gallon batch of imperial stout in the 1.100 OG range, he recommends “pitching the slurry from at least a 1-liter starter, or brew another 5-gallon batch of normal-strength stout or ale and repitch the slurry from that.”","Substitutions:
Homebrewers may use up to 5 percent caramel malt in the mash, depending on how sweet they wish the beer to be. Any of the high-alpha acid Pacific Northwest hops may be used alone or in combination. The homebrewer may also substitute English hops for a ""more mellow, traditional imperial."""

SRM: 50","Directions:
Mash grains at 156° F (69° C) for 60 minutes. The high mash temperature, caramel malt sweetness, and heft will help balance the beer when you dry it out with the bourbon/oak addition later on. Sparge at 168° F (76° C). Chill wort to 65° F (18° C), ferment for 7 days, and then allow temperature to rise to 68° F (20° C) and ferment to completion. This typically takes 10–14 days.
While you are waiting, boil 0.5 oz. (14 g) of white, untoasted French oak chips, 0.5 oz. (14 g) medium toast chips, and 0.5 oz. (14 g) heavy char chips in 8 oz. (240 mL) of water for about 5 minutes. Drain off the water, and soak the wet chips in 8 oz. (240 mL) of cheap, rotgut plastic bottle whiskey or bourbon for 1 week. Drain, donate the booze to your nearest sink (or even better, use it in a pork shoulder marinade prior to smoking) and this time soak the chips in 750 mL good-quality bourbon (cask strength is better if you are willing to make the sacrifice) for 4­ to 7 days. You should get vanilla from the white chips, coconut from the medium chips, and dark chocolate notes from the heavy char. Begin tasting the bourbon after 3 days. After the boil in water and pre-soak in cheap booze to extract harshness, you should now get subtle, harmonious flavors and aromas from the chips.
You are looking for a good, sweet, vanilla, coconut, and chocolate character that complements both bourbon and stout. When these flavors are detectable, and work well with the bourbon, it’s time to blend the soaking liquid into your finished or nearly finished stout. Add to taste—you don’t have to use all the bourbon, and you don’t have to add the soaked chips either, unless you feel the beer needs more oak character. Less is definitely more here—it seems like a whole lot of booze and a pitiful amount of wood, but this ratio will allow you to pull subtle, sweet barrel nuances from the chips, rather than harsh, dry tannins, charred wood flavors and bitterness. The bourbon itself will provide much of the flavor, and will bump up the alcohol on your stout a bit too, leaving you with closer to 10­–11% ABV, which is right in line with Dragon’s Milk. It will also dry out your beer appreciably, which is a good thing, because we’ve intentionally made the beer thick and sweet by mashing high.
If you choose to add the chips along with the bourbon, it will be worth monitoring the beer every few days. Chips have a lot of surface area, and the oak can very quickly become overpowering. Rack the beer off the chips when you have noticeable vanilla notes, blanketing your secondary with CO2 to avoid oxygen pickup. After a month or two, your stout’s flavors will blend and mellow appreciably.","Partial-Mash Option
Reduce pale two-row to 22 oz. (623 g). Substitute 8 lb. (4.08 kg) pale malt extract for the remaining two-row malt and 2 lb. (0.9 kg) Munich malt extract for the Munich malt.

Place crushed crystal malt in 2 gal. (7.6 L) of 155° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Then strain, rinse with 3 qt. (2.8 L) hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add the malt extract and 60-minute hops. Bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and Irish moss. When boiling is finished, add the “end-of-boil” hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 15 to 30 minutes, or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (20.8 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the first charge of dry hops. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (13° C) for about two weeks. Add the second charge of dry hops one week before bottling.

American cream ale with jalapeño chiles. Courtesy of Paul Holder and the Bay Area Society of Homebrewers.
Paul Holder, a founding member of the Bay Area Society of Homebrewers (BASH), has long enjoyed a blonde ale recipe originally plucked from the pages of Zymurgy six or seven years ago. BASH added a Tex-Mex twist by adding jalapeños to the mix. With the chiles and maize, this liquid bread is more like liquid jalapeño cornbread.

Determined to find a drinkable, flavorful beer for warmer days, but also wanting to remain coherent and fresh for evening activities, AHA Founder Charlie Papazian created “Embracing Sunset Lager,” a wonderfully balanced and relatively low alcohol lager that combines lightly toasted malt flavors with subtle hop character. This recipe was originally featured in 2002 March/April Zymurgy.
If you want to experiment with hops, choose low alpha acid ratings. High alpha acid hops will overpower the malt character and defeat the purpose of this beer - to enjoy on a summer sunset! Charlie believes this beer is a warm weather standard that should be brewed many times as supplies run out. Only one way to find out, though...","Ingredients:
7.0 lb (3.0 kg) Munich malt (7° L)
8 oz (225 g) Belgain aromatic malt
1.25 oz (35 g) Santiam, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood pellet hops (60 min)
0.6 oz (16 g) Crystal, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood whole hops or pellets (5 min)

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 7.5 quarts (7.1 L) of 145° F (63° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 157° F (69.5° C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter and sparge with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of runoff and add 60 minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes or long enough to end up with 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. When 10 minutes remain add 0.6 ounces of hops. After a total wort boil of at least 60 minutes (5.5 gallons should remain) turn off the heat and cool all the wort. Use an immersion cold water bath or heat exchanging coils. Then strain and sparge into a sanitized fermenter. Pitch a good dose of healthy active lager yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C) , then primary ferment at temperatures at about 55° F (12.5° C); make sure that nearly all of the fermentation is completely before lagering. Rack from the primary to the secondary. Your net yield will be five gallons (19 L) to the secondary. Lager between 35-40° F (2-4.5° C) for four to six weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when lagering is complete.","Extract Option
Ingredients for 5 gal (19 L):
(2) 3.3 lb cans (6.6 lb or 3 kg) pale/amber malt extract syrup
1.6 oz (45 g) Santiam, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood pellet hops (60 min)
0.6 oz (16 g) Crystal, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood whole hops or pellets (5 min)
0.25 tsp (1.25 ml) powdered Irish moss
0.75 cup (180 ml) corn sugar for priming bottles or 0.33 cup (80 ml) corn sugar for kegging
Oktoberfest style lager yeast or other Munich/Bavarian style lager yeast
Directions:
Add malt extract to 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) hot water.
Bring to a boil and add 60 minute hops. Boil for 50 minutes. Then add remaining Irish moss. When five minutes remain add the 5 minute hops.
After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which two gallons (7.5 L) of cold water have been added. If necessary add additional cold water to achieve a 5.8 gallon (22 L) batch size. Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F ( 21° C).
When evidence of fermentation is seen ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) range for about seven days or until fermentation is complete and appears to clear and darken. At this point rack (transfer) the beer into a secondary fermenter and lager between 35-40° F (2-4.5° C) for four to six weeks.

Boil the solution 10 minutes, cool briefly and add it directly to primary. Allow primary temperature to rise from 64° F to 78°F (26° C), applying heat if necessary. When final gravity is reached, usually after about 8 days, add (or rack onto) gelatin fining solution and crash to 32° F (0° C). Hold at this temperature for 21 days. Rack clear beer and blend thoroughly with a solution of 8 oz (227 g) dextrose and a dose of fresh yeast (an active starter of the Belgian Golden strain, or properly rehydrated Champagne dry yeast). Bottle in sturdy brown bottles. Keep bottles at 75° F (24° C) for two weeks to allow for carbonation. Chill a bottle and verify carbonation has reached around 4 volumes. If this is the case, cold-store remaining bottles for six weeks at 40° F (4° C) to allow beer to smooth out and mellow.","Malt Extract Version

Yield: 6 gallons (23 L)
Original Gravity: 1.038–1.042 (9.5–10.5 B)
Final Gravity: 1.012 (3 B)
ABV: 3.70%
IBU: ~20
SRM: 46","Directions:
Mash all grains at 152° F (67° C) for one hour. Lauter and sparge with enough 168° F (76° C) water to achieve a pre-boil volume of approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L). Bring wort to a boil and continue to boil for one hour, adding hops as indicated. When 10 minutes remain add Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat, strain out hops, and chill wort to room temperature. Direct the cooled wort into a sanitized fermenter, and add additional cold water to achieve a 6-gallon (23 L) batch size if necessary. Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Preferably ferment at 65–72° F (18–22° C) for about 7–12 days or until fermentation is complete and the beer appears to clear and darken. For best results, “cellar” or age at 50° F (10° C) for 2–3 days to help drop yeast out of suspension, but this is not at all crucial to the quality. Bottle with corn sugar. Age and carbonate/condition at temperatures between 60° and 70° F (15.5–21° C) until clear (about one week). Dusty Mud will quench the thirst and revive the spirit of simplicity and quality brewing. Teach a friend the way you first learned to brew—after all you’re still brewing and enjoying it!","Extract Option
Substitute the pale malt for 6.6 lb (3 kg) pale/light liquid malt extract.
Add the crush roasted barley, black malt, and crystal malt to one gallon (3.8 L) of 160° F (71° C) water. Let steep for 30 minutes. Afterward, strain out the spent grains, sparge with hot water, and collect the liquid extract. Add 1 gallon (4 L) additional water, the malt extract syrup, and all of the hops. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for one hour. When 10 minutes remain add Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (7.5 L) of cold water have been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 6-gallon (23 L) batch size. Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Preferably ferment at 65–72° F (18–22° C) for about 7–12 days or until fermentation is complete and the beer appears to clear and darken.

10 minute rest at 42° C (108° F), 1.5 L/kg (0.7 qt./lb.).
15 minute rest at 52° C (126° F), 2.4 L/kg (1.15 qt./lb.).
50 minute rest at 65° C (149° F), 3.5 L/kg (1.7 qt./lb.).
30 minute rest at 72° C (162° F), 4.6 L/kg (2.2 qt./lb.)

Boil: 90 minutes. Hop with 70 g (2.5 oz.) at 90 min (3.5 g/L, 0.47 oz./gal.) and 45 g (1.6 oz.) at 15 min (2.3 g/L, 0.30 oz./gal.).
Fermentation: If using a pure-culture, follow the guidelines for ordinary grisette and allow an extra day or two at warm temperatures if needed. The beer can be packaged at approximately 2 weeks old and consumed fairly fresh. This allows for grisette to modernize as saison has, changing from an aged mixed-culture historic beer into a modern pure-culture beer that is consumed fresh.
If using a mixed culture, ferment with your chosen blend until primary fermentation is complete. At this point, age at cellar temperature for 2–5 months (or longer if the FG is not yet stable) before packaging.
Packaging: Bottle or keg at 9–10 days from the start of fermentation (or longer if needed for clarity and complete fermentation). A slight haze is OK and likely would be fitting for the beer. I shoot for around 2.8–3.1 volumes (5.6–6.2 g/L) of CO2, depending on when I am packaging and the yeast I am using.
Optional: Dry hop with ≤1 g/L (≤0.13 oz./gal.) Styrian Goldings for approximately 4–5 days, starting at the end of fermentation when the beer would be cooled down.","EXTRACT VERSION

Fermentation: The exact fermentation schedule you chose will depend on the yeast you are using. I use the following for a highly flocculent and moderately attenuative yeast from a saison brewer that works well at cooler temperatures. Pitch at 19–20° C (66–68° F) and raise to around 23° C (73–74° F) over 3 days. Hold for an additional 2–3 days and then let fall to about 15° C (59° F).

All good Pilsner recipes start with German Pilsner malt—and only Pilsner malt—to be authentic. I wouldn’t mess with anything else besides maybe a little bit of acid malt,” he advises homebrewers. “Water is critical, as Pilsner was not a style originally brewed in places with hard water. It’s too hard to get the hops and malt flavor right when you have that alkalinity, so we lower ours a bit. We have a pH of 6 when we mash in and when we sparge. Anything over 7, I can’t recommend.”","Ingredients:
MALTS
9 lb. (4.08 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt (any German Pils malt is fine.)
2 oz. (57 g) Weyermann acidulated malt (if pH is high, use more, up to 1–2%)

186,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/johns-world-famous-dark-lager/,Not Found,"Dark American lager can be deceiving style to the eye. Ranging up to the mid-20 SRM, these beers may look as if they should be exploding with roast and coffee notes akin to stouts and porters, but can taste and smell more like a lighter-colored American lager.
Using de-husked dark specialty malts, like Carafa Special II, allows for a darker color without instilling the bitter and acrid notes typical of in-husk dark roasted barleys. This clean style should have very little malt in the aroma, a mild sweetness in the taste and subdued hoppiness in the flavor and nose.

Heat 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) water to 172° F (77.5° C) and then add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155° F (68° C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew. After 45 minutes, add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167° F (75° C). Then, pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170° F (77° C) water. Discard the grains. Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract and 60-minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn, off the heat and add the 0-minute hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (8 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55° F (13° C) for one to two weeks, or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the first dry hop addition. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures of 35–45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks. Seven to ten days before bottling or kegging, add the second dry hop addition. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

It's about that time when we start preparing for St. Patrick's Day, so a dry stout is in order. Brewing dry stout is easy when you have the right water. Low-alkalinity water, such as distilled or reverse osmosis water, is well-suited for brewing a dry stout. Low alkalinity allows wort pH to fall into a desirable range and creates the tart, acidic flavor that is a signature of its style. This recipe is the perfect place to start with dry stout, whether you're more excited about St. Paddy's Day or just playing with your brewing water pH.

Mash pale malt and flaked barley in low-alkalinity water (acidify as necessary to produce a mash pH of 5.3–5.5) at a temperature of 146–150° F (63–65° C) for 60 minutes. Add roast barley to mash at the end of mashing period. A mash out step to 168° F (76° C) is helpful, but optional. Sparge the mash with low-alkalinity water that is acidified to a pH between 5.2 and 5.7. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Minimal brewing salts are desirable in the water. As a starting point, when using reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water, add a half-teaspoon of both gypsum and calcium chloride per 8 gallons (30 L) of water, or use a program such as Bru’n Water to guide the mineral and acid additions.","Extract Version:
A partial mash is recommended to help break down the flaked barley. Mash 2 lb. (0.9 kg) of pale malt with flaked barley in low-alkalinity water at 120–150°F (49–65°C) (lower temperature is better) for 60 minutes. Add roast barley at the end of the mash. Sparge mash with low-alkalinity water (acidified as above). Substitute 3.5 lb. (1.59 kg) of liquid pale malt in the recipe. Use low-alkalinity water to dilute extract. Boil as indicated above.
Variations:
Many English hop varieties can be substituted in this beer. Irish ale yeast is preferred for its ester profile; however, a clean U.S. ale yeast may be substituted. For broadened flavor, an ounce or so of the roast barley may be substituted with black, coffee, or chocolate malt. If preferred, a separate liquor made from steeping the roast malt in low-alkalinity water can be created and added to the finished wort."

Hold temperature as close to 148° F (65° C) as you can reasonably manage over this period. (This is a small mash.) Stir occasionally. Additionally, heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to 170° F (77° C) in a small pot. And finally, heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to a boil in your brew pot. When the mash is over, transfer the grain bag to a 3-gallon (11-L) beverage cooler. (The kind with a spigot for dispensing beverages.) Pour the wort from the small mash gently into the cooler. Recirculate the wort by drawing off one or two cups into a measuring cup (or similar) and returning this wort to the top of the cooler. Repeat until at least 8 cups have been recirculated. Begin running off wort by collecting 1–2 cups of wort from cooler and transferring it to the brew pot. After each transfer, add an equal volume of water to the cooler from the pot of 170° F (77° C) water. Once this water (the sparge water) runs out, simply empty the cooler by continually drawing off 1 to 2 cups and moving it to the brew pot. When you are finished collecting wort from the cooler, dissolve roughly half of the malt extract in the brew pot and resume boiling. Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding hops with 60 minutes the boil. Do not let volume dip below 3 gallons (11 L) during boil. Top up with boiling water, if needed, to avoid this. Stir in the remaining malt extract during the final 10 minutes of the boil. When the boil is finished, cool the wort to 54° F (12° C), or as cool as you can get it with a reasonable effort. Transfer to a sanitized bucket fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch the sediment from the yeast starter. Ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). Take the lid off the bucket for the 1 to 2 days when the fermentation is at it’s most vigorous. Reseal the bucket and affix the airlock, as you normally would, after this period. When fermentation is over, prime beer with corn sugar in bottling bucket. If using standard beer bottles, prime for 3 volumes (6 g/L) of CO2 using 6.5 oz. (180 g) of corn sugar. If you are using heavy wheat beer bottles, prime for 4 volumes (8 g/L) of CO2 using 9.5 oz. (270 g) of corn sugar. Store bottles somewhere warm for two weeks. Check for carbonation, then move beer to cold storage.",

Place crushed grains in 2 gal. (7.6 L) of 150° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Then strain, rinse with 3 qt. (3 L) hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add malt extract and 75-minute hops. Bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 75 minutes. When 15 minutes, remain add the 15-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss and zinc fortified yeast. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 75 minutes, turn off the heat.
Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5 gal. (19 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of the wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at a temperature of about 55° F (13° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the dry hops. Lager the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (2–7°C) for 4 to 8 weeks.

The beer styles that we are familiar with today have, of course, evolved for many years. A few years ago, Alastair Kocho-Williams wrote a piece in Zymurgy magazine about how Soviet beer styles evolved from four standardized Soviet beer groups in 1927 to many styles encompassing dark ales, dark lagers, “black” beers, “caramel” beers, and much more. We imagine that the Baltic porter would have fit into the black category, which requires that the beers have a minimum original gravity of 1.052 and a minimum ABV of 1.2%. This brew certainly fits into that category ending in a whopping 10.2% - the rye malt adds a nice spice to complement the traditional flavor profile of a Baltic porter.

A well-made Belgian-style beer does not have a solventy, hot alcohol flavor, which is why fermentation temperature of this classic style is key to ensuring your dubbel doesn’t end up with a harsh alcohol taste. This recipe has a complex, malty, rich aroma topped off with mild tartness from the cherry concentrate. If you can afford the Belgian candi syrup and it’s available to you, it’s definitely worth adding to your ingredient list, as it adds a more intense flavor and aroma than Belgian rock candi sugar. If you can’t find Belgian candi syrup, a great alternative is molasses.

Conduct a mini-mash in a 3-gallon (11.4 L) stock pot using a 5-gallon (18.9 L) nylon mesh paint strainer bag from the hardware/paint store. Crush the grain and put it in the mesh bag. Heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) water to 165°F (74°C) (a ratio of 2 qt./lb. or 4.2 L/kg), and immerse the grain bag. Make sure all the grain is thoroughly wetted quickly and check the temperature. The mash temperature of the grain and water should now be about 150–155°F (66–68°C). Let mash sit for a half hour. Add heat while stirring to raise the temperature to 155°F (68°C) and let mash sit for another half hour. Place 2 gallons (7.6 L) water in a 5-gallon (18.9 L) boiling pot and heat to 165°F (74°C).

Note: You’ll need a 6-gallon (22.7-liter) or larger fermenter for this brew! Core apples by removing centers. A grill designed for smoking food is self-explanatory. If you use a charcoal grill, use enough charcoal to provide a low and even heat. Add pieces of fruitwood, maple, oak, hickory, mesquite, or your wood of choice atop the charcoal. Place apples on grill and cover with lid to enable wood to smolder. Leave vents open to keep the charcoal lit and alive. Don’t char the apples, but rather slow cook and smoke them. Remove when soft and lightly browned, yet firm enough to remove from grill. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate for later use, or add to the wort as instructed later in this recipe. Add malt extract and 60-minute hops to 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water. Bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 20 minutes remain, add smoked apples and the 20-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. After total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Strain out and sparge apples and hops, and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.25 gal. (19 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1.5–7° C) for 3 to 6 weeks.

If you are conducting a cereal mash, begin that first. Add the rice and 1 lb. (454 g) milled Pilsner malt to a heavy-bottomed stockpot on the stove. Slowly raise the cereal mash temperature to at least 154–155° F (68° C). After a 15-minute rest at this temperature, add heat to slowly ramp up to a boil, and continue boiling for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, mash in with the remaining 9 lb. (4.08 kg) of Pilsner malt, starting with a protein rest at 122° F (50° C), monitoring pH if necessary. After 20 minutes, add the hot cereal mash to the main mash and blend well to stabilize at 149° F (65° C), then hold for 50 minutes. (If you are using flaked rice, skip the cereal mash directions and simply mash everything together, beginning with the protein rest, then raising the temperature to 149° F for the main rest.) Mash out at 168° F (76° C) and hold 10 minutes, then commence sparge. Run off and add first wort hops. Boil and add Whirlfloc and hops at stated intervals. Chill wort to 48° F (9° C) as quickly as possible, run off into fermenter, oxygenate, and cold-pitch yeast slurry from your previous Pilsner batch. Fermentation should be allowed to free-rise from 65° F to 68° F (18–20° C) during the first 2–4 days. Ferment at 48° F (9° C) until signs of fermentation are evident (usually within 36 hours). Ferment at 50° F (10° C) for the next two weeks, allow temperature to free-rise to 55° F (13° F), and ferment until activity slows. Conduct a long diacetyl rest at 60° F (16° C) until terminal gravity is reached (7 to 14 days) before crashing the beer to lagering temperature.

Recipe courtesy Zymurgy editor-in-chief Dave Carpenter
As I worked my way through Kent Schultz’s vivid narrative of a September spent in the Hallertau, I was transported to the cozy biergartens and hop fields of southern Germany. I imagined the sun dropping a little lower into the sky every day as the heat of summer gave way to autumnal crispness. And when I learned that Georg conducted safety inspections at the G. Schneider & Sohn brewery in Kelheim, I found myself longing for a tall, vase-shaped glass of the Original.
This recipe is inspired by Schneider Weisse Tap 7 “Mein Original.” I would never presume to call this a clone, but it is a tribute to one of my favorite examples of one of my favorite beer styles. The technical details here are largely based on Stan Hieronymus’s interviews with brewmaster Hans-Peter Drexler in Brewing with Wheat, with a few adjustments here and there. I hope you like it.
I think the key to this beer is open fermentation. Yeasts, like humans, behave differently under pressure. An open fermenter lets the beer breathe and reduces carbon dioxide concentrations in the fermenting wort. It makes a difference in the flavor. If you maintain rigid sanitation throughout the process, an open fermenter needn’t worry you. I ferment in plastic buckets, so I loosely place the sanitized lid on top to keep airborne cat hair from falling in. When the beer hits final gravity, I close and seal the lid, add an airlock, and let it sit until I have time to bottle. There’s no need to secondary this beer, and it’s best when it’s fresh.","Ingredients:
MALTS
6 lb. (2.72 kg) German Pilsner malt
3 lb. 11 oz. (1.67 kg) German pale wheat malt
2 oz. (57 g) German chocolate wheat malt
HOPS
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertauer Herkules, 14% a.a. @ 45 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertauer Tradition, 5% a.a. @ 15 min
YEAST
Weihenstephan W68, available as Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan Weizen and White Labs WLP300 Hefeweizen Ale Yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (18.9 L)
Original Gravity: 1.052 (12.8° P)
Final Gravity: 1.011 (2.6° P)
ABV: 5.40%
IBU: 14
SRM: 9","Directions:
Mash in at 113° F (45° C) for a 10-minute ferulic acid rest. Using direct heat or a hot-water infusion, raise the mash temperature to 122° F (50° C) for a 10-minute protein rest, and then again to 147° F (64° C) to begin saccharification. After 5 to 10 minutes, pull a thick decoction of approximately 1/3 of the mash.
Keep the main mash at 147° F (64° C) while you separately step the decoction through rests of 152° F (67° C) for 10 minutes, 158° F (70° C) for 20 minutes, and finally to boiling. Boil the decoction for a few minutes—longer for more color development, shorter for less. Finally, return the decoction to the main mash and, if necessary, apply direct heat to hit mash-out at 168° F (76° C).
Collect enough wort to yield 5 gallons (18.9 L) after a 90-minute boil, and boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Pitch yeast at 62° F (17° C) and allow to free-rise to 72° F (22° C) over the course of 5 days. Leave the fermenter open until a gravity reading indicates that fermentation is at or very near completion, then seal with an airlock.
Bottle condition or force carbonate to 3.5 volumes (7 g/L) of CO2. This is at or above the limit of what many standard single-use beer bottles can handle, so if bottle conditioning, be sure to use sturdy glass.","EXTRACT OPTION
Replace the Pilsner and wheat malts with 7 lb. (3.2 kg) wheat malt extract syrup. Steep the chocolate wheat malt in 155° F (68° C) water for about half an hour, then remove the grain, dissolve extract in the steeping liquid, top up to your boil volume with tap water or reverse osmosis water, and proceed with the boil. If you conduct a concentrated boil, increase the Herkules addition proportionally or add it earlier in the boil to compensate for decreased hop utilization in high-gravity wort."

For many of us, urban living is a way of life, but that shouldn’t stop us from homebrewing. Mary Izett felt the same way when she faced the challenge of making beer in her Brooklyn apartment. You, too, can get creative with your brewing so that space isn’t a limitation. In this 3-gallon (11.3-liter) batch, Izett uses the the brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) method to make an all-grain, all-rye malt recipe. With a much looser mash and no sparge, an all rye beer or a traditional Grätzer is a piece of cake. This beer produces a spicy warmth and a bready flavor that will go perfectly with your cozy urban apartment.

In the mid-1800s, Baltic porter as a style relieved a formative transformation: lager yeast. Cold shipping of the first strong porter exports had mellowed the English-brewed porters, but beers brewed in the Baltic countries needed yeast adapted to ferment cool, not just condition cold.
Lager yeast therefore became the Baltic brewery standard; ale yeasts were unsuitable, and strong porters lost much of their ale yeast-derived ester and phenols,, gaining signature lager smoothness.","Ingredients:

Bock (German for goat) is likely a descendant of some of the oldest German lagers in the world. It evolved in the Franconia region of Germany, just north of modern day Bavaria. Bock has one of the largest ranges of the German beers and can be light (like a helles bock or maibock) to very dark; it can also be moderate to very strong in alcohol. A traditional bock is generally not hoppy, but more malt forward and brewed to at least a starting gravity of 1.064. We sat down with Larry Leinhart, owner and brewer at Prost Brewing Co. in Denver, Colorado to see how he brews his traditional bock. Prost Brewing Co. is  a brewery that has made a name for itself as a lager brewery. Their brewhouse is a classic copper German two-vessel system built in 1963. This recipe was originally featured in the November/December 2011 issue of Zymurgy. ","Ingredients:
8.6 lb. (3.9 kg) Munich II malt

Raise the mash to 158°F (70°C) and rest for 30 minutes. Raise mash to 170°F (76°C) and begin runoff. Boil: Collect 7.25 gallons preboil and boil for 120 minutes. Post-boil volume will be about 5 gallons (19 liters) with a vigorous boil. Ferment at 50°F (10°C) to terminal gravity (3.5°P, 1.012) and rack into a clean and sanitized carboy. Lager at 34°F (1°C) for 6–8 weeks. Prime with 3.3 oz. (94 g) of dried malt extract at 40°F (4°C) and bottle. Allow to sit at 65°F (18°C) for two weeks, chill, and drink!","Extract Version:
Substitute 9.5 lb. (4.31 kg) Munich malt extract syrup for Munch I and Munich II malts. Steep crushed Carafa II malt in 160°F (71°C) brewing water for 30 minutes, remove grains, and dissolve extract completely before proceeding with boil. Note that the boil may be shortened to 70 minutes, but the resulting beer may not be as complex as the all-grain version and may finish at a higher gravity, depending on the brand of Munich malt extract."

(11.4 L) Keep a separate pot of water boiling in case you need to top up the wort during the boil. Stir in sugar and yeast nutrients for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and rack to fermenter. Aerate well, pitch yeast, and ferment at 70° F (21° C). Keg or bottle condition. You can push this beer with nitrogen if you like, but I think it tastes better with “normal” CO2 bubbles.","Extract Version

A copper-colored ale with a nice “Fuggly” hop aroma and malty flavor. I designed and refined this to be a flavorful but quaffable everyday beer. If you are hung up on beer styles, you can call it an altbier, although it’s really built from the ground up based on the flavors and characteristics I wanted.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4.5 lb. (2.04 kg) US 2-row pale malt
1.19 lb. (540 g) Munich malt (10° L)
2.4 oz. (68 g) aromatic malt
1.8 oz. (51 g) Victory malt
1.2 oz. (34 g) chocolate malt
0.67 oz. (19 g) black malt

WATER
Carbon-filtered tap water, carbonates around 100 ppm, calcium around 75 ppm
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
1/4 tsp. (1.2 mL) calcium chloride (optional)
3/5 tsp. (3 mL) Irish moss
3 oz. (85 g) corn sugar for priming to 2.6 volumes (5.2 g/L) of CO2

Heat 8.8 qt. (8.3 L) of brewing liquor to 163° F (73° C) and mash grains in your brew pot at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Stir the mash a couple times and heat briefly to maintain temperature. Heat mash, while stirring, to mash-out temperature of 168° F (76° C). Scoop mash into 3 gal. (11.4 L) beverage cooler lined with a mesh steeping bag. Recirculate wort until almost clear, then run off. Sparge steadily over 45 minutes to collect 3.5–3.8 gal. (13.2–14.4 L) of wort. You will need around 8 qt. (7.6 L) of sparge water, heated to 170 °F (77° C) for this. Bring wort to a boil. If hot break is not big and fluffy, add optional calcium chloride. Once the hot break forms, add bittering hops and vigorously boil wort for 60 minutes. Add remaining hops and Irish moss at times indicated to yield a post-boil volume around 3.25 gal. (12.3 L), topping up with boiling water if needed. Chill wort and rack to fermenter. Your yield should be about 3 gal. (11.4 L). Aerate wort thoroughly, pitch yeast, and ferment at 68° F (20° C). After fermentation stops, let beer settle for 2–3 days, then rack directly to keg or secondary fermenter. Carbonate to 2.6 volumes (5.2 g/L) of CO2.","Extract Version
Substitute 3.25 lb. (1.47 kg) pale malt extract syrup for pale malt. Mash remaining malts at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Drain, rinse grains with 170° F (77° C) reverse osmosis or distilled water. Dissolve extract completely in wort, then continue to sparge until desired boil volume is reached. Proceed as above."

SRM: 15","Directions:
Mash grains at 154° F (68° C) for one hour. Mash out at 168° F (76° C), and sparge at 170° F (77° C). Collect enough wort to account for evaporation from the long 120-minute boil. After an hour of boiling, add the 60-minute hops. At 15 minutes, add either 1 Whirlfloc tablet or 1 tsp. (5 g) of Irish moss. After the boil, stir wort vigorously to create a whirlpool and precipitate out the trub. Chill wort to 63° F (17° C) as quickly as possible, run off into a fermenter, pitch yeast, and oxygenate for 1 minute using pure oxygen. Fermentation should be allowed to free-rise to 67° F (19° C) during the first 4 days. It can then proceed at that temperature for another 10 days until terminal gravity is reached. Transfer to secondary (glass or stainless steel preferred), and cool to 36° F (2° C) and cold condition for 2–4 weeks. VARIATION While it is not traditional, some brewers choose to forgo the long boil and instead run the first 3–4 gallons (11–15 liters) of strong wort into the kettle, then stop runoff and boil that wort for 30 minutes. This creates caramel-like flavors and darkens the wort. Then the remainder of the wort can be run into the kettle and boiled another hour with the bittering hop charge.","Extract Version
Substitute pale malt with with 8.5 lb. (3.86 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Decrease roast barley to 4 oz. (113 g) and steep in 155° F (68° C) reverse osmosis (RO) water for 30 minutes. Remove grains. Dissolve extract and top up to desired boil volume with RO water. Add hops and boil 60 minutes. Proceed as above."

Alex Grote claimed bronze in the 2009 Great American Beer Festival® Pro-Am Competition for his Brighid’s Red ale, brewed by Doug Odell at Odell Brewing Co. in Fort Collins, Colo. Grote has been brewing since his college days and likes to blur the lines between styles, as is the case with his Irish Red ale. His inspiration for using rye in the recipe came from positive results from previous homebrew recipes–he liked the complexity it added to his beers.
Brighid’s Red won Best of Show at the 2009 Liquid Poetry Slam competition in Fort Collins. A representative from the Odell Brewing Co. helped judge at the Best of Show round, and the brewery recognized Grote’s beer as the one they wanted for Pro-Am, and the rest was history.
“Working with Doug Odell to brew this beer was an amazing experience,” said Grote. “It was particularly interesting to spend the day with Doug and talk about his beginnings and how he makes beer and to see the many similarities to homebrewing that still exist at the commercial level.” He found that many homebrew techniques like active mash temperature control and wort recirculation are used in the commercial brewery. And he was happy to see that the finished product so closely matched his homebrewed beer.

They're the United Kingdom's most decorated brewery. They devised the extra special bitter (ESB) beer style that has become a perennial favorite of North American craft brewers. Their name is synonymous with traditional British ales. They're one of the few independent London breweries that have managed to survive and thrive while others have faded away. They're Fuller, Smith & Turner, though their products are simply called Fuller's.
This ESB has won more CAMRA awards than any other beer. It was chosen as Britain's best strong ale seven times and was three times selected as the Champion Beer of Britain. The amber ale reveals a rich malt character and is noticeably aggressive on the palate. Many drinkers pick out an orange-citrus essence, which is characteristic of the house yeast. It finishes with a hop bitterness that lingers without harshness.

A deliciously complex dark Belgian ale, Ommegang Abbey bursts with dark fruit and malt aromas, gingerbread spice, a pineapple fruitiness, and a subtle but powerful alcohol warmth. Culturing the house yeast strain will give you the most authentic results, especially at the temperature specified, but a pure culture strain also works well. The caramel red malt, Special B, Belgian chocolate, and dark candi sugar all conspire to produce the deep reddish tint and velvety beige head of this luxurious ale. It takes several weeks of conditioning to attain the proper level of carbonation and dryness in the beer, so be patient—it is well worth it.

We all (well, maybe not all of us) brew a cup of coffee to get us going every morning, so why wouldn't you brew beer with coffee? There are three major factors that affect what flavors you extract from your coffee: grind level, temperature, and contact time. With those factors in mind, it is best to add coffee to your beer one of two ways: you can either add brewed coffee to your beer or steep the coffee beans directly in your beer.
This recipe was inspired by Furthermore Beer's Oscura by putting the flavor of the coffee front and center.

Their team name was inspired from C.S. Lewis' The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and their goal was to set out on a quest to find a new and exciting beer recipe. It's safe to say their quest was a great success! They gambled on the Dupont Saison yeast from White Labs (WLP-565) in this competition, partly because of a Zymurgy article they read focusing on Saisons, and partly because of their will to just go for it.

Ferment at 70°F (21°C) for about one week, or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary, and add the hop pellets for dry hopping.

This extreme beer is boiled for a full two hours while being continually hopped with high-alpha American hops. At 21% ABV and 120 IBU, this is one of the biggest IPA ever brewed. This brew is generally unfiltered and abundantly hoppy, which is probably why Dogfish Head appropriately nicknamed it the Holy Grail for hop heads. Dogfish only brews this beer a couple of times of year, so it makes perfect sense to brew this one yourself so you have some of your own to sip and some to age.

Use a single infusion mash at 149°F (65°C) using a ratio of 1.3 quarts water to 1 pound of grain for the base malt. The sugar is added during fermentation. Brewer Andy Tveekrem says, “The key to making a copy of our 120 Minute IPA is to add hop pellets continuously throughout the 2-hour boil. You will be adding more hops than you think are prudent. Start the main fermentation with the first ale yeast at 72°F (22°C). Two or three days later, prepare a 2-quart starter for the high gravity ale yeast. After the main batch has fermented for several days, or when primary fermentation is about half done, add the high gravity ale yeast. Feed the fermenter twice daily with dextrose that has been liquefied with the fermenting beer. 35 to 40 percent of the overall fermentables should come from dextrose. Feed the sugar for approximately 7 to 14 days. The length of time and the final alcohol level depends on yeast health and temperature. Add yeast nutrient every other day. Monitor the gravity before and after feeding to ensure that not too much sugar is being added. Stop feeding when the yeast can’t take any more, or the beer will end up too sweet. Also add a small charge of hop pellets each day to enhance the hop aroma. This beer will require multiple rackings to clarify. Bottle conditioning is not recommended since the alcohol will inhibit further yeast activity. The final beer should be at least 18% ABV.”","Partial Mash Option:

In London, the brewing industry is growing quickly, just like ours here in the United States. New breweries have transformed London's beer scene, and many of their brewers share a significant trait: they started as members of the London Amateur Brewers (LAB) before going pro. Graham O'Brien, along with other friends from LAB, launched Pressure Drop Brewery at the end of 2012. They started on a 13.2-gallon (50-liter) system in O'Brien's house but soon began to look for a location that would host a 6 to 10 barrel system. Stokey Brown, one of their flagship brews, combines the maltiness of a brown ale with some added hop punch.

In true Burton beer fashion, this beer is largely focused on perfection of water quality alongside traditional English malts and hops.
There's a history behind why people love this beer. There once was a British euphemism, ""gone for a Burton."" It was thought to have originated from a story about a British pilot who didn't return from a mission during the Battle of Britain and was said to have ""gone for a Burton."" It basically suggested he'd stepped out for a beer and may not return after a while. Funny thing...this beer's about the same. It's going to be an investment of your time and your space, but a year later you're going to have what many Americans believe to be a ""smoky IPA"", or a strong ale similar to a pale ale, but much darker and sweeter than India Pale Ale. This English style results in a more sophisticated, mature flavor due to prolonged cellaring that allows special flavors to develop.

This Cranberry Saison Automne was inspired by Unibroue’s Quelque Chose, which is a beer made by blending beer-soaked wild cherries into the final product. The impetus for the cranberries in this recipe was to maximize the fermentation of the sugars by adding them to the mash rather than adding them for flavor at the end.
Frozen cranberries were chosen because the cell walls would be ready to burst so as to get as much flavor as possible, while a relatively cool mash allows for maximum fermentable sugar extraction. The finished product has a flavor very much like a semi-dry white wine with lots of vinous overtones.

Stir in first dose of calcium chloride and gypsum as you mash in. Stir mash every five minutes. (Add heat to keep temperature from dropping.) After 20 minutes, begin checking for conversion with an iodine test. Once test is negative (no starch indicated), or nearly so, collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort from grain bed. (You can do this very quickly; for example, by batch sparging.) If possible, run off wort to your hot liquor tank (HLT). If not, run off to kettle and transfer to your HLT. This wort is your brewing liquor. Heat it to 152° F (67° C). Quickly clean mash tun and combine 15 quarts (14.2 L) brewing liquor with crushed malts and flaked maize to mash at 140° F (60° C). Add second dose of calcium chloride and gypsum. Mash for 30 minutes, then raise temperature to 152° F (67° C). Stir mash when heat is being applied and raise temperature by approximately 2° F (1° C) per minute. (Do not add hot water to raise temperature.) At 10-minute intervals, take a reading of the density of the wort (by refractometer or hydrometer). Record time and specific gravity or Brix. Stir the mash and add heat to maintain mash temperature as needed. Decide when to stop mashing based on the rate of change in wort density. (Eventually, mashing for another 10 minutes will yield only a few extra gravity points.) Heat the mash to 168° F (76° C) for mash out. Recirculate wort until it’s mostly clear and begin running wort off. Use remaining wort from first mash as sparge water (heated so that the grain bed temperature remains near 168° F). Sparge slowly to get as many sugars from the grain bed as possible. Do not use water to sparge at the very end (this will dilute the wort). Collect enough wort for a 90-minute boil. Bring the wort to a boil, and boil for 90 minutes. Add hops with 75 minutes left in boil. Cool to 68° F (20° C) and rack 5 gallons (18.93 L) to fermenter. Aerate the wort thoroughly and pitch the sediment from your yeast starter. (Especially if your OG is over 1.100, aerate for one additional minute eight hours after pitching.) Ferment at 68° F (20° C) until primary fermentation ceases. Rack finished beer to a keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes (4.8 g/L) of CO2.

Doppelbock literally means “double bock.” It is more extreme than a regular bock, but not twice so, with alcohol levels between 7 and 8 percent by volume. Its roots go back to the Paulaner branch of the Benedictine order of monks who were resident friars of the Dukes of Bavaria. Having witnessed strong beer-making in the noble brew houses, they tried their hands at the brew themselves, and soon this new and strong liquid bread became the obvious meal of choice for their frequent fasts.
The doppelbock is a strong, very malty German lager with appreciable alcohol, sweetness, and malt-driven flavors and aromas. Brewed correctly, this beer is an easy-drinker “brewed for holy nourishment,” but it is often overdone, which can make it overly big and alcoholic, so avoid that if you can.

""Sippin' on the Dock of the Bay IPA,"" brewed by McIlhenny and Gulbransen was inspired by the success of California pro brewers in the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup in the American IPA and Double IPA categories. This is what San Diego brewers like to call a California IPA.
According to Gulbransen, ""Pat, a San Diego Country fire captain (when not brewing beer), is a great brewer and supporter of homebrewing. He has been a longtime member of QUAFF and an overall great guy. This beer will not be a double IPA, but more like an American IPA...a bit more quaffable.""

Combining the smooth taste of a wheat-based beer with the prominent hop characteristics of an American IPA, “white IPA” is a newly emerging franken-style of beer that seems to be growing in popularity.
This recipe, featured in the July/August 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine, is for a clone of Deschutes Brewery Chainbreaker IPA. Here is what Deschutes co-brewmaster Brian Fairve had to say about the recipe:
“Our white IPA malt bills are composed of Pilsner malt, pale wheat malt, and unmalted wheat. We occasionally use flaked oats to add a bit of smooth, creamy mouthfeel. We have also been experimenting with dextrose as an additional carbohydrate source in these beers to increase the ABV and dry them out slightly.
Our hop bill is fairly simplistic—we use Bravo in our first addition for bittering. We don’t really see a point in mid to late kettle hopping for this beer. We really want it to have a nice bitterness with an amazing hop aroma, so we choose to hold off any additional hopping until it enters our hopback. We make up for the lack of hop additions in the kettle by overloading our wort stream with copious amounts of hopback hops.”","Ingredients:

A decade ago, Jamil Zainasheff wrote an article in the May/June 2006 issue of Zymurgy regarding the delicate art of adding hops late in the boil.
His late-hopping epiphany came to him while drinking Alesmith's Halloween seasonal known as the Evil Dead Red. Zainasheff recalls the beer as having ""substantial malt character, smooth bitterness, luscious mouthfeel, and an evil-looking, almost blood-red color...[with an] amazing hop flavor and aroma from start to finish.""
Zainasheff discovered that the recipe involved adding all but 3–4 IBUs of hops in the last 10 minutes of the boil, as revealed by AleSmith owner Peter Zien. After picking Zien's brain, Jamil came up with his own version of the seasonal he appropriately titled the Evil Twin. This beer is rich and malty, but with a devilishly huge hop aroma and flavor. It's the perfect homebrew recipe for malt lovers and hopheads alike.","Ingredients:

Vinnie Cilurzo says about the groundbreaking Blind Pig IPA:
“Blind Pig IPA was first brewed in Temecula, Calif. at my first brewery, Blind Pig Brewing Company, in 1994. This version was 92 bittering units and had very little malt with a very forward hop character. In December 1996, I left the brewery and my former business partner continued the brewery for a few years. After the original brewery closed and I was at Russian River Brewing Company, we were able to trademark the name and start making Blind Pig IPA again. The recipe has changed, in that we have added a couple of new hop varieties that were not in existence when the brewery in Temecula was open.”

In 2011, Colorado's first brewpub, Wynkoop Brewing Company, teamed up with the American Homebrewers Association to create a dream collaboration beer appropriately named Collective Hoppiness. Quite literally a collective effort, Wynkoop hosted a rally in which the brew's hop additions were continuously added over a 90-minute period by local members of the AHA and 210 members who participated in the hopping of the beer.
Wynkoop describes the beer as “an unctuous imperial red ale made with premium two-row base malt, small amounts of rye, aromatic malts and flaked oats, and five kinds of hops (Summit, Cascade, Sorachi Ace, Amarillo, and Columbus). All fermented with an English ale yeast. Ultra hoppy from start to finish, the beer finished at 8% ABV and has approximately 100 IBUs.” We couldn't help but think that a bunch of hop-lovin' homebrewers would want the opportunity to brew this hoppy masterpiece, so we've scaled it down to a 5-gallon batch for our members' brewing enjoyment.

Though earlier variations of the law were adopted almost half a century before its official enactment on April 23 that year, the law eventually would go into effect across all of Germany.
Among other reasons, the law was originally adopted to control the price of grain used in the brewing process and only allowed brewers to use three ingredients in their beer: water, hops, and barley. The law has since been adapted to modern regulations, but its impact on the history of brewing and beer styles is still renowned today.
In honor of the 500th anniversary of the Reinheitsgebot, the American Homebrewers Association is celebrating its impact by encouraging homebrewers worldwide to brew their choice of two recipes: a Northern German Altbier or a spiced beer.

Marzen style favors elegance over poundability. It combines a richer, breadier, toastier mélange of malt flavors and aromas, with a darker, fuller body that still is a festively drinkable beer. The light Munich malt will create bread crust complexity, and although the dark Munich toast aromas and flavors can be intense at first, they will blend, mingle and mellow with other malt nuances during lagering.
Marzen also doesn't favor the hop head. You don't want hop aroma, but rather darker toasted and bread crust aromatics of Munich malt that are balanced by the hop bitterness. In the end, we can't imagine why you wouldn't want to give this style a try finishing dry, crisp, balanced and refreshing.","Ingredients:

Soured Fruit Beer (28C) is a new category in the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines, however, this style of brewing is anything but new. Some of the first brew concocted thousands of years ago included local and seasonal fruits and most certainly were sour to some degree. Despite its ancient origins, this style is seeing a renewed birth at the hands of creative brewers around the world.
According to the 2015 guidelines, soured fruit beer can be made from any number of base beer styles and any fruit imaginable, but a couple of key characteristics must be present. First, microbes other than Saccharomyces must be used to contribute a defining “funk” or acidity. Another key attribute is that the flavors and aromas of fruit must be identifiable and must complement the base beer flavor.
Kevin Wright, director of brewing at Hanger 24 in Redlands, California, shares this Sour Blonde with Apricot recipe found in 2015 May/June Zymurgy. Fresh apricots bring the taste of summer to this bright, sour ale. Remember it’s important to plan your brewing and aging correctly to be able to add the fresh apricots at the peak of harvest.

272,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/browneywine/,Not Found,"In 1974, a few beer-loving Americans decided that the brew they could buy was no match for what they had tried around the world. Their philosophy was if they couldn't buy it, they could sure try and make it, thereby banding together to create the Maltose Falcons, America's oldest homebrew club.
To honor the club's achievement in hitting 40, Allen Tracy, another club member, was visiting family up the Central Coast of California. He stopped by Firestone Walker Brewing in Paso Robles and chatted up brewmaster Matt Brynildson, who invited the club to come brew any beer recipe they wanted with them. (Lesson of the day: Always ask award winning brewers if you can brew with them - they sometimes say yes!).
The club board, led by Steve Cook, developed a homebrew recipe for a barleywine-strength brown ale aged in rum barrels that was called browneywine. More than 40 members made the 3.5 hour trek to the brewery and were given a run of the brewery, anxiously waiting to enjoy the 40th anniversary party in October to taste the Browneywine.","Ingredients:

Old Rasputin is produced in the tradition of 18th century English brewers who supplied the court of Russia's Catherine the Great. The Old Rasputin brand image is a drawing of Rasputin, a Russian peasant, mystical faith healer and a trusted friend to the family of Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia, with a phrase in Russian encircling it - A sincere friend is not born instantly.
Old Rasputin clone, found in July/August 2007 Zymurgy and created by Amahl Turczyn, is a huge, complex beer, heavy on flavor and aroma, with lots of warming alcohol. It will age well, but with lots of late hops, you may want to let it condition for only a month or so.
As with any high-gravity beer, pitch double the yeast you normally would - it's a great beer to pitch the dregs of another beer into. The California ale yeast does very well with this beer, and can handle the extra-high gravity. The grain bitterness is controlled very well with the use of dark crystal and brown malts to temper the roast and chocolate. The first sip might not be too friendly, but sincere friends are not born instantly.","Ingredients:

When Old Man Winter comes knocking at the door, it helps to have a warming, malty doppelbock beer in hand. Doppelbocks are strong, dark beers that were drunk by eleventh-century Bavarian monks to help sustain themselves during winter fasts. These creamy bocks ensured that the monks would fast frequently.
Gordon Biersch’s Winter Bock is a classic, dark doppelbock that delivers a well-rounded, earthy malt profile and, despite the higher alcohol content, is deceptively drinkable. It’s not quite as full-bodied as some other doppelbocks, but what Winter Bock lacks in strength, it makes up for in taste. As the cold months approach, the Winter Bock, with its earthy, malty backbone, is the perfect comfort drink on a cold night.","Ingredients:

Found in July/August 2003 Zymurgy, this Celebration recipe Ale is a hop-head’s dream; swimming with hop flavor on a pleasant malt base, it will turn away the uninitiated, but thrill those with a taste of lupulin. Like many great beers, it is as simple as it is good.
First brewed in 1981, it is one of the earliest examples of an American IPA, and one of the few, but very welcomed, hop-forward holiday beers. Its intense citrus-pine aromas and grapefruit flavors are a treat for the colder weather months when beers get thicker and darker.

The Dark Winter Saison IV is similar, aged in currants and a wine-soaked oak stave that helps it become rich and vinous.
The beers smells of dank Brett funk, with raisin aromatics from the currants and some red wine as well. As it warms, you might notice vanilla from the oak. It’s a dry beer, but not too much so. It should taste lightly tart, with minimal bitterness and a slight warming alcohol feel.

The west coast IPA started off as a local trend, and has emerged as an perpetually-evolving style defined by brash bitterness, intense hoppiness, and rather high alcohol by volume.
Although there are many notable beers that are dubbed ""west coast IPAs,"" the Green Flash West Coast IPA recipe clone, found in the July/August 2013 issue of Zymurgy by Amahl Turczyn, Associate Editor of Zymurgy, embodies the style perfectly. After all, Green Flash trademarked the term ""West Coast IPA"" and slapped it on their label.
The plethora of hops creates a layered drinking experience of bitterness and hop-forward flavor and aroma. The additions of Simcoe and Centennial give off tropical grapefruit and piney notes respectively, while the Cascade hops add some floral quality to compliment the spicy citrus notes of the Columbus and Amarillo hops.

If you have the time, it’s worth the effort—but with modern malts, one can make a decent Pilsner using an infusion or step mash.” “I’m also blessed with naturally soft water, so brewers should take a good look at their water profile and either dilute with distilled or RO water, or lower the hop additions if they have significant sulfate levels.” “By the way, the Chodsko is a scenic region that borders Germany in western Bohemia.”","Extract Version

While attending the Brewers Association's SAVOR event in Washington, D.C., Charlie tried a rosemary-infused IPA called Rosemary Swamp Fox IPA.
John Pinkerton, owner and brewmaster of the Moon River Brewing Co. in Savannah, Ga., poured Charlie a taste. At first he experienced what seemed to be a new hop character in the aroma and flavor, but instead it was the delicate character of fresh rosemary.
Charlie tinkered with the amount of rosemary in his homebrew version, and transformed the recipe from an IPA to a pale ale using a recipe he found in the January/February 2012 Zymurgy. The goal was to give the beer a hint of rosemary that can be mistaken for an exotic hop character, while exploring the mouthfeel and nuances that oats create. He also added a little agave to lighten up the body and a touch of caramel.","Ingredients:

To brew the Delirium Oat Rosemary Pale Ale recipe, a step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 9.5 quarts (9 L) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain (but not the oatmeals and cup of pale malt), stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132°F (53°C) for 30 minutes. Add quick oatmeal and 1 cup crushed pale malt to 6.25 quarts (4.5 L) of water and bring to a boil. When malt mash has finished its 30 minute rest, add the boiling hot “oatmeal” water to the mash, bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60 minute hops and agave syrup and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30 minute hops. When 10 minutes remains, add 10-minute hops and Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Ferment at about 70°F (21°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets and rosemary for dry hopping. If you have the capability, cellar the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Extract Version

Directions:
To brew the Delirium Oat Rosemary Pale Ale Recipe, heat 2 quarts (2 L) water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains and quick oats to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes, add heat to the min-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains.
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produce, bring the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract, agave syrup, and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15-30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary add cold water to achieve a 5.5 gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Ferment at about 70°F (21°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets and rosemary for dry hopping. If you have the capability, cellar the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week.

Lagunitas' Little Sumpin Sumpin is nothing short of delicious.

It pours bright orange to copper in color, with grapefruit and orange aromas tingling your nose. After your first sip, you'll experience some citrusy hops along with earthy hops before it smooths out in a creamy and slightly bitter finish.

Amahl Turczyn, assistant editor of Zymurgy magazine, takes a stab at Sierra Nevada’s Ruthless Rye in the July/August 2012 Zymurgy, which makes use of proprietary experimental hops in the aroma and dry hop charges. Reliable sources have said the brewery’s mystery hops are similar to a blend of Columbus and Amarillo, so those have been used as stand-ins.
With a name like Ruthless Rye, you’re certainly in for something hearty and rustic. You’ll experience strong hop flavors due to dry hopping, which allows the aromatic oils and resins to be absorbed into the beer without an overpowering bitterness. When you add in rye’s spicy, black pepper flavor and dryness with the complex fruity, floral and herbal hop profile, you’ll end up with a balanced beer with incredible flavor, bringing the rye and hops to life finished with a ruthless, hoppy kiss.

Frederick ""Fritz"" W. Rahr, Jr., founder and president of Rahr & Sons Brewing Company, shared this Ugly Pug schwarzbier clone recipe in the 2010 July/August Zymurgy.
Schwarzbier, or ""black beer,"" is a dark lager from Germany. However, unlike most dark beers that are usually described as ""heavy,"" this schwarzbier is light bodied and refreshing that can be enjoyed on the hottest summer days. While sipping it down, you'll find flavor notes of coffee and chocolate, but nothing too overpowering to take away from the beer's drinkability.
This beer may have been named after Fritz saw his mother-in-law's pug, Oscar, and shouted, ""What an ugly pug!"" while they were drinking a test batch, but don't let that deter you from trying it. This beer pairs beautifully with everything from roast beef, BBQ, and fried chicken to the richest, most delicious chocolate desserts.","Ingredients:

Remove 20 to 23 percent for a second decoction. Bring decoction to a boil and boil for 15 minutes, then add back to main mash to hit mash out at 168°F (76°C) and hold for 10 minutes. Collect enough wort for a 2.25 hour boil. Chill beer to 48-49°F (9°C) and transfer to fermenter, keep the wort as clean of trub as possible. Oxygenate well. Consult Mr. Malty to calculate the correct yeast-to-wort ratio needed. Begin your starter one week ahead of time at 68-70°F (20-21°C). The day before you brew, drop starter down to 48-49°F (9°C). After your wort is cooled to 48-49°F (9°C), pour off as much of the spent starter as possible without losing any yeast. Add some of your wort from fermenter and swirl to get the yeast in suspension and add to your fermenter. In nine to 12 days, when fermentation is about 70 percent done, raise fermenter temperature to 60-62°F (16-17°C) for a four to five day diacetyl rest. After this, fermentation should be complete. Transfer to kegs and lager for two and a half to three months at 32-34°F (0-1°C). I like to go to a secondary for a month before I keg to let the beer clear up. This doppelbock was nine months old when submitted for judging at the NHC. Primary fermentation at 48-50°F (9-10°C). Forced CO2 to carbonate (2-2.4 vol.).","Extract Option

Single infusion mash for 90 minutes at 156°F (68°C) with a water/grain ratio of 1.25 gallon per pound. Drain and sparge to collect 7.25 gallons (27 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes.

Chill to 66°F (19°C) and ferment with an appropriately sized starter of WLP380. After krausen begins to fall (four to five days), allow temperature to free rise to 70°F (21°C) and continue fermenting until complete. Please rouse the yeast. This is NOT a krystal weizenbock. Bottle conditioning is a must for the style. Bottle and prime with enough DME to produce 3 volumes of carbonation. This ale requires patience for the rich malt and dried fruit flavors to mature, so age at cellar temperature for several months to reach optimum flavor. Primary fermentation for four to five days at 66°F (19°C). Secondary fermentation for seven days at 70°F (21°C). DME to carbonate to 3 vol. CO2.","Extract Option

In 2008, homebrewer-turned-pro Patrick Rue opened The Bruery in Orange County, CA. He started to play around with witbier recipes, and created a classic style wit, as well as this opaque and rich Black Orchard Wit. This recipe was featured in the May/June 2009 Zymurgy article, ""Seeing the Light: Belgian Session Beers.""
Witbiers are a brewer's playground. For one, fruits and spices pop from its sweet, bready profile. Also, the beer descends from gruit ales—an old herb mixture used to bitter and flavor beer. Now, your spice collection suddenly has a little more purpose. For example, clove, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon will give a numbing sensation that cuts sweetness. Try using spelt or other grains for some of the wheat to play with the flavor profile.
In the end, a witbier should bring the full experience of Belgium and still allow you coherently hold a conversation. So, when the mid-week beer craving hits or you're planning out a brew day, oft for a refreshing, light witbier ale instead.","Ingredients:

Homebrewers in Poland are making some incredibly high-quality, world-class beers and are turning heads all over the world. In June 2013, a five-judge panel from Austria, Belgium, England, Germany and the United States chose Czeslaw Dzielak's Imperial IPA as grand champion in Poland's largest homebrew contest, Konkurs Piw Domowych Birofilia.
When Czeslaw Dzielak's Imperial IPA won best of show at Birofilia 2013, none of the other homebrewers appeared surprised. Tomasz Rogaczewski, co-founder of Pracownia Piwa (Poland), explained that was because everybody expected Dzielak to have won already. He had brewed over 250 batches of beer and was an eminent figure in the homebrewing community. Later that year, Zywiec Brewery released Brackie Grand Champion Birofilia 2013 Imperial IPA, made using Dzielak's recipe. Talk about a great year! He then earned a second straight grand champion award at Birofilia 2014 with his dubbel.
The 32-year-old Dzielak teaches history and physical education at a secondary technical school. He's written a business plan and acquired some of the necessary licensing, but still needs investor financing if he is to open his own brewery. Should he succeed, we're sure the other competitors in Polish homebrew contests may well be as happy about it as he is. Now, as they say in Polish ""Juz pora zaczynac warzenie domowe!""

Drew Beechum, AHA Governing Committee shares this Bastage English Summer Ale in his article “Express Brewing: From Grain to Glass in 6 Days” found in 2011 November/December Zymurgy issue.
It’s an ale and made for summer consumption. What else is there to say? Inspired by the hoppy ales of southeastern England, this is a beer that explodes with a refreshing taste from its earliest age. It will have some hop presence that plants its bitterness in the English pale ales of today, but brings along a rich complexity of soft citrus and resinous aromas. Balanced with the reduced maltiness and white wheat malt, this beer has a great balance that keeps things light and sessionable.

However, for the hophead who likes to have a few pints and still walk away, the session IPA is a wonderful thing. It gives you a bitter slap in the face and a rich hop blast on your tongue, without the expected buzz of a full-strength IPA. It matches a pale ale (or lower) strength beer, but is lighter in malt and meaner in hops.

Homebrewing enthusiasts are becoming more and more interested in sour beer. However, the amount of aging required can be daunting. How can you replicate a beer aged in large oak casks in your glass carboys or plastic buckets?
Another issue is fermenting your beer with bacteria or mixed cultures. There's a threat of cross-contamination if the same equipment is used to make a conventional beer. Investing in another set of brewing equipment is a painful idea.
Matt Lange, a freelance writer and award-winning homebrewer from Madison, Wisconsin, shares his wort souring method by creating a sour starter, which will save you time, give you more control over the level of acidity in the final product, and eliminate the threat of cross-contamination. However, it might lack the complexity of slow aging sour beers. But just like many sour beers, it can create surprising results!

Mash at a lower temperature 148-150°F (64-66°C). Souring: After the mash, bring the wort to a boil, then cool to 100°F (38°C). Inoculate using either a commercial culture of Lactobacillus or a homemade sour starter (see below) culture as describe below. Try to keep the wort warm during the souring period (placing the wort back into a picnic cooler-type mash tun works great for this). Let it sour for 18 hours, then boil 90 minutes, adding your bittering hops at 60 minutes. Ferment at around 68°F (20°C). Sour Starter: Three days before brew day, take a small amount of malt and add it to a solution of warm water and sugar (malt extract or table sugar works). A few tablespoons of malt placed in a pint of low gravity sugar solution (around 1.030 OG) should be a good sour starter for a 5 gallon (18.93 L) batch. Allow it to sit for three days at around 100°F (38°C), which helps create a better culture than simply adding malt to the wort or mash. It utilizes the pH tolerances of different bacteria to isolate the good ones from the bad ones. By the third day, your sour starter is ready to be used to inoculate the wort. Continue with your brew day as you normally would.","Extract Option

The American Homebrewers Association (AHA) created AHA Big Brew as an annual event to celebrate National Homebrew Day around the world. AHA Big Brew is held each year on the first Saturday in May.
The 2015 AHA Big Brew recipes come from three time AHA Ninkasi Award winner and current BJCP President, Gordon Strong! This year’s beers are all medal-winning recipes from Gordon’s upcoming book, Modern Homebrew Recipes, to be released in May 2015.
If you are looking for a way to put a twist on this Kolsch recipe, take a tip from AHA Director, Gary Glass: “I recently got together with some fellow Brewers Association staff members to brew a Kolsch. Inspired by a local brewery, we decided to make a coffee variation of the Kolsch by making a concentrated batch of cold-steeped coffee that we then put in a condiment dispenser. By adding variable doses of the coffee concentrate to a glass of Kolsch, we could customize our coffee Kolsch to our own tastes.”
From Modern Homebrew Recipes: “I fell in love with this style after a visit to Cologne in 2006. I had enjoyed it before, but it didn’t seem like anything special. Trying it fresh made all the difference… The style allows for subtle changes in balance in several components (malt, hop flavor, bitterness, fruitiness), but all were hovering around moderate intensity. I won a number of NHC first round medals with this recipe, which is in the style of a Früh or Reissdorf.”","Ingredients:

Gose (proununced gose-uh) is an obscure beer style to many. Emerging out of Goslar, Germany, gose is brewed with wheat malt, fermented with ale yeast and flavored with coriander and salt. It has a light sourness like a Berliner weisse and was more than likely wildly fermented, like Belgian lambic beers.
Although sour brewing can be risky to brewing equipment, there are several methods laid out in the article ""Gose"" found in the 2015 March/April Zymurgy issue, as well as general souring knowledge in Michael Tonsmiere's American Sour Beers.
Gose is a rarity, and homebrewers have the advantage of brewing beer styles that are hard to find on shelves. The recipe below is a homage to Rittergutsbrauerei Döllnitz's gose. Try it out and let us know what you think!

Reserve 14 of the 16 ounces of milled, acidulated malt. Mash the remaining 2 ounces acid malt with Pilsner and Wheat malts, along with rice hulls at 149°F (65°C) and hold for 45 minutes. Add remaining acid malt and continue to mash, stirring every 15 minutes, for another 45 minutes. Don’t worry if mash temperature falls slightly during secondary mash. Add heat to bring the mash temperature up to 168°F (76°C) and sparge at this temperature until runoff wort gravity reaches 1.008 (2° P) or pH 5.8 (whichever comes first). Collect enough wort in the kettle to allow for a final volume of 5.5 gallons after a 60 minute boil. Use fresh, whole coriander seed ground in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, and add 5 minutes before the end of the boil. Chill to 70°F (21°C), aerate and pitch. Ferment at 68°F (20°C) until terminal gravity is reached. Crash to 40°F (4°C) and cold condition for one week, then rack. Add salt and lactic acid to taste, blending thoroughly. Two ounces of lactic acid at bottling (along with the acid malt contribution from the mash) will result in a mildly tart gose, whereas 3 ounces will be noticeably tart. Package and carbonate or bottle and prime. Note: If adding gyle, sugar or malt extract to prime, be sure to taste for the correct acid and salinity balance before blending in priming.","Extract Option

Substitute 6.9 lb (3.12 kg) wheat malt extract syrup for the pilsner and wheat malt. Omit rice hulls and acid malt. Dissolve extracts completely and proceed with boil. Note that color may be slightly darker (5.3 SRM) with the extract recipe, and more lactic acid will likely be needed at bottling to achieve the same level of tartness. Also due to the omission of acid malt in the mash, acidity might be somewhat one-dimensional compared with the all-grain version."

Newcastle Brown Ale, called simply “Newkie” by many fans, is actually a blend of two beers. Brewers blend a strong, dark ale that’s been aged with a younger, amber ale. The result? An average-strength brown ale that comes in full and malty with an ever-so-slight dark fruity aroma and butterscotch flavor, and balanced with hop bitterness for a refreshing, dry finish. So it’s no coincidence homebrewers have come up with many Newcastle Brown Ale clone recipes.

Perfect for a dark and stormy night, Drew Beechum's ""My Smoked Dark Heart"" is a smoked black lager with soft roasted notes and a malt body resting somewhere between Pilsner crisp and Bock maltiness. As Drew would warn you, don't depend on English-style chocolate and black patent malts for deep blackness. The beer will have an overabundance of roast and not taste like a lager. He recommends Weyermann's line of Carafa® chocolate malts, as well as Carafa Special malt because the husk is taken away to remove aggressive flavors and roast acidity. To Drew, the Carafa Special tastes like dark toffee blended with your favorite mild coffee.

If you're looking for a beer with malt up front and hops right behind it, look no further. This strong bitter comes up with a nice floral and hop aroma from the Centennial and Cascade hops that complements the 19 pounds of rich maltiness. The beer's well balanced hops and malt flavor give it great drinkability.
And if that isn't enough for you, this style is known for finishing well with appropriate warmth and hop bitterness. It has a medium to full body and the 10 pounds of forced CO2 give it the appropriate amount of carbonation. One judge from the 2002 NHC believed this beer had ""no major flaws.""

After visiting Bohemian Brewery in Salt Lake City, Charlie Papazian had a hankering for the subtle complexity and thirst-quenching satisfaction of a Vienna-style lager, but already had plans to brew a tried-and-try English mild ale. In true homebrew fashion, Charlie decided to combine the best of both worlds to create Sweet Mischief Vienna-Mild.
Here is what Charlie had to say about the recipe in the May/June 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine:
""The unique roast character of the brown malt and the caramel sweetness of the crystal m alt along with lower gravity represent mild ale-ness. The generous amount of mellow, toasty Munich malt along with neutral base Pilsner malt heads in the direction of a Vienna lager. Belgian aromatic malt always contributes a great goosing if rich malt aroma and flavor is desired. The small amount of Belgian aromatic malt is subtle and has kind of a catalytic effect, helping emphasize the Munich and Crystal.
Dry hopping with Crystal hops imparts an aromatic character appropriate to both English ales and German lagers. I wanted to give this beer a lager-like emphasis in bitterness and flavor, so I used German Hallertauer in the long bittering boil and American Mt. Hood to contribute a honey and floral-like flavor, though with a 45-minute boil most of that character is minimized. The overall balance of this beer emphasized subtlety yet offers satisfaction in those thirst and sessionable occasions.""","Ingredients:

In many ways Düsseldorf altbier is the essence of a hybrid beer. The term “alt” refers to an old German style of brewing using ale yeasts, before bottom fermenting yeasts were widely available. Fermentation temperatures are kept on the cooler end of the ale spectrum, creating many of the smooth characteristics found in lagers but with an ale yeast.
The medium bodied ale showcases the richness of specialty malts while allowing for noticeable bitterness to make an appearance. Altbier is a great style to session for both malt and hop heads alike.

This recipe comes from Charlie Papazian's column “World of Worts” in the July/August 2004 issue of Zymurgy magazine.
Maibocks, or helles bocks, are traditionally served in the spring, specifically in May, throughout Germany. Often described as a Munich helles with bock strength, or as a paler take on the classic bock style, Maibocks offer the malty notes and strength characteristic of a bock, along with slightly more pronounced hop aroma than your typical bock.

SRM: 7-11
Boil Time: 60","Directions:
Note from Charlie: Because the full volume is boiled, you will see better hop utilization. Less bittering hops are needed to achieve the same bitterness as in the mash-extract recipe. Heat 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) water to 172°F (77.5°C), then add crushed Pilsner and aromatic malts to the water. Stir well to distribute the heat. Temperature should stabilize to about 155°F (68°C). W rap a towel around the pot and set aside for 45 minutes. Have a homebrew. After 45 minutes, add heat to the mini-mash and bring the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Then pass the liquid through a strainer and rinse the grains with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard Grains. Add more water to the sweet aromatic extract you have just created. Bring the volume up to about 3.5 gallons (13L). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and boil for 45 minutes. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 15 minutes remain, add 15 minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. When one minute remains, add one minute crystal hop pellets. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot in a running cold water bath for 15 minutes. Strain out and sparge hops and direct hot wort into a sanitized fermenter where two gallons (7.6 L) of cold water have been added. Add water if needed to achieve a final volume of 5.5 gallons (21 L).","All Grain Version

After a total wort boil time of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold water bath for 15 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill the wort.
Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the volume to 5.5 gallons (21 liters) with  additional cold water if necessary.
Pitch yeast when the temperature of the wort is about 70°F (21°C).
Once visible signs of fermentation are evident ferment at temperatures of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week, or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping.
Rack from your primary into your secondary and add hops pellets for dry hopping.
If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35°F - 45° F (1.5°C - 7°C) for three to six weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete."

Boil Time: 90 minutes","Directions:
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 151°F (66°C). Hold the mash at 151°F (66°C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring, or with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to mash out at 168°F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170°F (77°C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.052 (12.9°P).
The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add lactose and Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left. Chill the wort to 68°F (20°C) and aerate thoroughly. Use 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5 liter starter.
Ferment at 68°F (20°C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. At this point you have an excellent milk stout. To make the chai milk stout you will need to add a tincture of chai spices.
Chris explains, “For the chai spice, I simply take a cheap vodka and soak our house chai spice mixture in it, then add small doses to a keg until it tastes right. I try to make a very strong spice tincture so there is only a negligible amount of vodka added to the beer. Usually it only takes 0.4 oz of tincture to spice 5 gallons of beer. Frankly, I am not certain what is in our chai spice mixture, but I am sure your favorite chai spice mix will work great. Make additions slowly and taste as you go so you can hit it just right.”","Extract Version

Specific step-by-step directions are not provided with this recipe, but the same general steps highlighted in Brewing with Specialty Grains can be used. Steep the grains in 1-3 gallons of 150°-170°F (65.6°-76.7°C) water for 30 minutes and remove. Stir in half of the malt extract until fully dissolved and bring to boil. When the boil starts, add the 90 minutes hops. After a 90 minute boil time, remove heat and add the remaining malt extract. Allow to sit for up to 10 minutes to pasteurize. If possible, chill the hot wort below 80°F (26.7°C) before transferring to the fermenter with the cold water. If not, simply transfer the hot wort into the fermenter with cold water and allow to cool (note: DO NOT transfer hot wort into glass carboys). Once the wort is near or below 60°F (15.6°C), pitch yeast. Lager fermentation requires the wort to be held around 50°F (10°C) while in primary. After fermentation, the beer is transferred to a secondary vessel where it will be held around 35°-40°F (1.7°-4.4°C), and eventually brought up to around 60°-65°F (15.6°-18.3°C) late in the lagering stage.

If you want to try your hand at a lager, Polka Dot Pilsner is a great place to start with a recipe consisting of one type of malt and one type of hop.
Lager fermentation requires the wort to be held around 50°F (10°C) while in primary. After fermentation, the beer is transferred to a secondary vessel where it will be held around 35°-40°F (1.7°-4.4°C), and eventually brought up to around 60°-65°F (15.6°-18.3°C) late in the lagering stage.
If you cannot control temperatures this low, an ale yeast such as an altbier yeast can be used to mimic a lager, while allowing homebrewers to ferment in the ale temperature range.

It would have to be something strong enough to calm his nerves after an evening of globetrotting, but quaffable enough to beg another sip.
Samichlaus, once the strongest beer in the world at 14% ABV, came to be in 1979 when Swiss-based Hürlimann Brewery decided to brew a Christmas lager on December 6—St. Nicholas Day (feast day). Until its doors closed in 1997, Hürlimann Brewery produced Samichlaus every year on December 6, and built up a loyal fan base along the way.
Samichlaus, the Swiss-German name for Saint Nicholas, is an enormous dopplebock weighing in at 1.140 specific gravity that undergoes nearly a year of lagering before being bottled and enjoyed in the following year’s holiday season. Despite the founding breweries closure, this festive lager was able to live on through homebrewers and eventually another commercial brewery, Braurei Schloss Eggenberg, in 2000.
Drew Beechum describes how his homebrew club, the Maltose Falcons, turned December 6 into their own Samichlaus tradition:
“The Falcons had a long love affair with Samichlaus since we have quite a few guys who specialize in lagers. They would get together every year and taste the vintages. Just before I joined the club, though, Hürlimann Brewery closed down —no more Samichlaus.
Kevin Baranowski and the rest of the crew eventually decided that this just wouldn’t stand, so every December we got together and brewed a scant 5.5 gallons of the brew. Over the years we tried a number of lager yeasts and Kevin shepherded the beer through its near year of fermenting at lager temps. We finally nailed the beer in all of its strong sweet massively potent glory when White Labs released the “Zurich Lager” strain.
The best way to do it—brew a smaller beer ahead of time and use the entire yeast cake, all of it, to get the fermentation down to the right gravity. When you’re dealing with a 1.140 starting gravity you need all the help you can get!”","Ingredients:

“Not-So Pilsener was a memorable discovery of the unique character that late hopping with French Strisselspalt hops brought to my brew. Not a traditional Pilsener, this 20-percent rice lager is a variation on a theme, such was the desire to lighten the body without compromising malt and hop character. I’ve brewed a similar recipe in years past with great success, but this time I bumped up the rice from 10 to 20 percent and played around with the delicate nature of American Mt. Hood and French Strisselspalt hops….
…As the beer was consumed over a period of time, the intensity [of Strisseltpalt’s unique flavors] did not diminish. Always there to awaken the floral fruity joy of sweet apricot, quickly to recede, giving way to noble hop flavor and bitterness of Mt. Hood hops and a Not-So Pilsener enjoyed in the hot months of summer or the crisp of winter ” (p. 52-53)","Ingredients:

In October 2005, Tom Nolan brewed a Baltic porter that would go on to be one of his most successful beers to date. At a monthly homebrew competition held by the Winston-Salem WortHawgs, Nolan's recipe was chosen by Foothills Brewing to scale up and brew in their facility. Small adjustments were made to the homebrew recipe, resulting in a higher gravity and slightly lower IBU, but it was still noticeably Nolan's creation.
After spending a hard day brewing with the Foothills crew in June 2006, which to Nolan's surprise was quite similar to his homebrewing routine (complete with boil-over), the beer sat in fermenters getting ready for competition. The collaborative effort of Nolan and Foothills Brewing was rewarded with a gold medal at the 2006 GABF Pro-Am Competition as well as silver in the Baltic porter category in that year's commercial competition.","Ingredients:

Mash in with 1-2 quarts of water per pound of malt and hold around 153-157 °F (67-70 °C). Sparge with water around 170 °F (77 °C), using enough to compensate for evaporative loss during the boil. Boil for 90 minutes, with a bittering hop addition in the beginning and an aroma hop addition towards the end. Ferment in the range of 60-70 °F (15-21 °C), though you should try and stay within the recommended temperature range as dictated by the yeast.  ","Water Treatment Calcium 50-100 ppm; sulfate 100-200 ppm; chloride 20 ppm
Serving Style Draught only at 52-55 °F (11-13 °C) (recommended).
Priming 2-3 oz (56-85g) cane sugar
CO2 v/v 1.0-1.5
Extract Plus Steeped Grain Version
Replace British two-rowed pale malt and wheat malt with 4.0 lb (1.82 kg) of pale malt syrup and 0.7 lb (318 g) of pale dry malt extract. Increase bittering hop addition to 2.5 oz (71 g). Steep crystal malt around 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes in about 1.5 gallons of water. Top off your kettle, add extract, and bring to boil. Follow the same boil and post-boil procedures as the all grain recipe.
Mini Mash Option
One pound of extract can be substituted with 2 lb (0.9 kg) of pale malt to do a partial mash. Mash the 2 pounds of pale malt with 1-2 quarts of water at around 150 °F (65.5 °C). Strain of the liquor, and rinse the mash with hot water. Add collected runnings to kettle."

Add 1 lb of rolled oats and 1 cup of crushed pale malt to 5.5 quarts (4.3 l) cool/warm water and bring to boil for 15 minutes. Add the boiling water, oats and malt to infused grain mash and add heat if necessary to bring temperature up to 155o F (68o C)and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167o F (75o C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 l) of 170o F (77o C) water.  Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 l) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops, rapadura sugar and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minute remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gallons (19 l) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70o F (21o C). Ferment at about 70o F (21o C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Prepare the hop oil by using a pipette to carefully add 2 drops of oil into a sanitized beer glass into which you’ve added about 1 tablespoon (about 15 ml) of grain alcohol or 100+ proof vodka/neutral spirits. Swirl and blend oil into alcohol. Add about 4 oz of cheap light lager beer to further disperse oil into mixture. Add dispersed oil/beer/alcohol mixture into your secondary fermenter and then rack beer from primary into the secondary. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55o F (12.5o C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.

0.25 tsp Irish Moss, powdered
0.75 cup Corn Sugar (priming bottles) or 0.33 cup corn sugar for kegging
1 packet/vial English Ale yeast or Cry Havoc yeast
Directions:
Heat 5.5 quarts (5.2 l) water to 172o F (77.5o C) and add crushed grains and oats to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155o F (68o C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 60 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167o F (75o C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170o F (77o C) water. Discard the grains.
Add to the sweet extract you have just produced more water, bringing the volume to about 2.75 gallons (10.5 l). Add malt extract, rapadura sugar and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minute remains add the 5-minute hops.

Dubbel’s are characterized as medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale with a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma. It tastes sweet up front, but finishes dry. This is because of the layering of the specialty grains (usually CaraMunich or Special B). The dry finish also is attained by mashing at a lower temperature than you typically would for a sweeter beer. It is also a great beer for brewers that are just starting to brew all grain. However you can create an extract that is comparable using Munich or Amber extract or even a little corn sugar to increase the original gravity.

This is a blend of two beers, refermented with grape juice concentrate from a 1-gallon winemaking kit.
The first beer is a Flanders red–style ale. Mash 60 min. at 152°F (67°C). The only hop addition is 2 oz. of low-alpha Strisselspalt at 60 min. Chill to pitching temperature of about 70°F (21°C), and pitch House and/or Roeselare blend of microbes. Primary 30 days in an HDPE container. (Some natural oxygen ingress through the HDPE during primary is desirable for the style.) Secondary at least 6 months, or as much as 18 months in stainless steel.
Mash: You can alter the mash temperature higher or lower. Because this recipe calls for a blend of Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus, all sugars will be metabolized in time. A lower mash temperature will mean more easily digestible sugars for the Saccharomyces and a cleaner beer. A higher mash temperature means more longer chain sugars and more influence from the non-Saccharomyces microbes.
Hops: You can use different hops, as Strisselspalt is not always available. I recommend a variety with a floral or herbal aroma, and keep the IBUs around 10. More IBUs than that may inhibit Lactobacillus, which is the primary souring microbe.
Microbes: My Flanders red lives in a 10-gallon stainless steel keg, which is a single-vessel solera. Every year, I remove 5 gal. from the tank to blend into a final product and replace the removed volume with 5 gal. of new beer I make after I let it primary in the HDPE. (Let the microbes settle in primary and rack; you don’t want the yeast cake in the solera keg to increase every year).
The microbes in my solera are a house blend that gets more complicated with each yearly cycle. At this point, it includes wild-caught yeast, which I isolated from a homebrewed, spontaneously fermented lambic-style ale; commercial blends from various yeast labs; and bottle dregs from commercial sours and wild ales. If you use bottle dregs, make sure they aren’t from breweries that pasteurize or use a killer strain to bottle condition. The Milk the Funk Wiki has a list of breweries whose bottles have good dregs for this purpose.
I recommend a solera, as the product you will have for blending becomes fractionally more mature and complex each year. I am on year 5 of my solera, and in my opinion the product now rivals my favorite commercial sour ales. However, you don’t need a solera to make a great sour. My favorite commercial blend for this style is Roeselare Blend from Wyeast. I have made great beers with this blend alone, but it does take time to mature.
After a long time maturing, the Flanders red may become too sour to be enjoyable on its own, so I blend it with a second “clean” beer to cut the acidity, and reintroduce some malt backbone, sweetness, and complexity.
The second beer this year was a saison. My brew club friend Mark Pennick had a simple house saison that had just finished primary fermentation. Mark has won NHC gold in the past for his specialty saison. He gave me 2.5 gal. of his basic saison. He says:
In a grain bag, steep specialty grains in 158°F (70°C) water. Use a 10-gallon kettle with enough room for full volume boil of extract. Pre-boil volume of 7.5 gal. (28.4 L) to make 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Hop per schedule. Pitch 1 L starter of WLP568 to have at least 265 million cells. Pitch at 72°F (22°C) and hold at that temperature for at least 10 days, maybe up to 14 days.
I pasteurized the Flanders red because I didn’t want those microbes to sour the clean saison addition. I heated the red to 135°F (57°C) and held for 30 min. I then chilled it to 70°F (21°C) and blended it with the saison. We sampled different blending ratios and liked 1:1 the most.
I had some Cabernet Sauvignon grape juice concentrate from a 1-gallon wine kit I had never made and decided to experiment. I added the 1.32-liter bag of concentrate to referment the blended beer. After it was done, I added priming sugar to achieve about 2 vol. (4 5/L) of CO2 and bottled. Let the bottles condition for at least a month, but longer is better.
Crafting sours is more of an art than a science. You can alter many of these steps and make an exceptional product. Don’t be afraid to taste test over time, experiment with something new, and change course as you go.",

Pitched Roeselare Ale Blend and added dregs from a few wild fermentation beers I enjoyed. Fermented at basement temperatures between 62°F (17°C) and 72°F (22°C) year-round.
Brewed this five times over the course of about 14 months with minor variations due to ingredients on hand in order to step up the culture by re-pitching fresh wort on yeast cake/culture and transferring clearing wort into secondary fermenter. When this was done, the secondary vessel was purged with CO2 prior to and following the transfer. With first addition to secondary fermenter maltodextrin was added, along with bottle dregs from multiple high-quality wild beers, and a packet of Brettanomyces Bruxellensis. Also, occasionally added bottle dregs throughout fermentation when I came across an especially good wild beer in order to increase the diversity of bacteria and yeast in the culture. Aged one year in secondary before bottling.
Bottled using Champagne yeast and corn sugar to 3 vol. (6 g/L) CO2 guessing it would end up slightly lower due to aging time.",

With all the roasted malt, you don’t need lactic acid to achieve a suitable mash pH. I add 2 g baking soda to boost the pH to 5.4–5.5, which I find helps with this style. Also, I always add potassium metabisulfite to eliminate chlorine. I acidified the sparge water to a pH of around 5.5.
Omega Yeast is local to the Chicago area. I have had great experience with getting very fresh, viable yeast and therefore can simply pitch yeast packets directly for fermentation. For this batch, I pitched one yeast packet.",

This recipe is intended to be “pumpkin pie in a glass.” The combination of malts provides the sweet, crackery crust; butternut squash provides more “pumpkin” flavor in beer than canned or even fresh pumpkin; the spices give classic pumpkin-pie flavor; and lactose and vanilla supply body, subtle sweetness, and the perception of the whipped cream on top. Cube and roast 5 lb. (2.27 kg) butternut squash sprinkled with a few tablespoons of brown sugar at 350°F (176.7°C) until caramelized and soft, about 1 hour. Treat water with lactic acid to achieve a 5.2 mash pH. Mash at 155°F (68°C) for about 60 min. Run off and sparge as usual. Add butternut squash to the boil in a nylon bag and boil for 60 min. At end of boil, remove squash and add kettle spices, lactose, and Whirlfloc. Chill, aerate well and ferment in low 60s °F (16–18°C). At kegging, add remaining spices and the split, scraped vanilla bean—vanilla and spices are added directly to the keg, so use a bag or a dip tube screen if needed. The keys to making a standout beer are to use fresh spices, a high quality vanilla bean, and a larger pitch of yeast than you think you need.",

Use a no-sparge BIAB method. The large grain bill and lack of sparge lowers efficiency, so fermentables are supplemented with DME. The larger batch size compensates for hop absorption and yields a full 5-gallon keg. Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 60 min. Add FWH, then bring to a boil for 75 min. Add DME if gravity needs a boost. Reduce wort temperature to 170°F (77°C) and add INCOGNITO and whirlpool hops. Use multiple yeast packets, or a stepped starter to achieve 400 billion cells. Begin fermentation at 68°F (20°C) and let free rise to 72°F (22°C). Soft crash to 50°F (10°C) on day 12, drop yeast, dry hop for 3 days, then drop temperature to 35°F (2°C) and perform a closed transfer to a CO2-purged keg.

Even though the pitch rate is low, I like to create a small starter in order to ensure my yeast has high viability and vitality.
Mash all grains (except the acidulated malt) at 152°F at 1.33 qts/lb. Hold for 45 min and then add the acidulated malt and enough water to keep the water-to-grain ratio. Hold for 45 more minutes and then sparge with 168°F (75.6°C) water. These two steps take more time, but they will allow for the pH drop without affecting conversion.
Boil for 1 hour, adding the hops, bitter orange peel, and Whirlfloc at the indicated times. Chill to 65°F and pitch the starter immediately. Let free-rise to 70°F (21.1°C), but no higher if possible.
WLP007 finishes super fast. If you made that starter and pitched at high krausen, it will be done and cleaned up after itself in 2-3 days.

Robby shares this about his award-winning pilsner:
Saw Down Unda completes the perfect hoppy, but still crispy Pilsner, making it a perfect drinker for any day of the year. The Enigma and Galaxy hops from Yakima Valley Hops bring a nice tropical and white grape aroma to the light, crispy Pilsner that makes it very enjoyable. The malts used in this are locally grown grains in Eastern Washington and then malted at LINC malt out of Spokane. This brings a grain character to the brew that makes it stand out with some great hay/warm brown bread aromas. This beer will bring your tastes from the farmland where the grain is grown to the tropical fruit hop flavors of the southern hemisphere.","Ingredients:

The following recipe was originally featured in the article “Small Batch Brewing” by Dan Jablow (Jan/Feb 2023 Zymurgy magazine).
Here’s the full recipe for my SMaSH ale, which I still brew frequently to experiment with new hops, yeast, malt, or brewing processes. I typically use a two-row pale malt.
This recipe is designed with the novice brewer in mind, so I’ve skipped some key steps here, including water chemistry adjustments and gravity readings. These can certainly help you make great beer, but a good understanding of techniques, process, and gaining comfort with your brewing setup are much more important as you get started.
Bitterness will vary with the hops you select. Consider starting with a variety that offers moderate alpha acids, such as Cascade, to establish a baseline. The next time you brew, you can try a higher- or lower-alpha hop for more or less bitterness.","Ingredients:
MALT
2.25 lb. (1.02 kg) milled base malt of your choice
HOPS
0.5 oz. (14 g) any hop of your choice @ 60 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) the same hop @ 15 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) the same hop @ 0 min
YEAST
Any variety of yeast will work. I recommend starting with a dry yeast, as it is easy to measure the amount required for a 1-gallon batch. Fermentis and Lallemand both make excellent dry yeasts in 11-gram packets, enough to brew a typical 5-gallon batch. Since we’re only brewing a single gallon, we need one-fifth of that packet, or 2.2 grams. Having the jeweler’s scale here is helpful. Tightly package up any remaining yeast and store in the refrigerator for future use.
WATER
1 gal. (3.8 L) for mashing
0.75 gal (2.8 L) for sparging
Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gal. (3.8 L)
Original Gravity: 1.055-1.065
Final Gravity: varies with yeast selection
ABV: varies with yeast selection
IBU: varies with hop selection
SRM: 4-10 (depending on malt selection)","Directions:
Heat 1 gal. (3.8 L) water to 160°F (71°C). Add the milled malt and mash at 147-150°F (64-66°C) for 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, increase the temperature of the mash to 170°F (77°C) and hold 10 minutes for mash out.
While you’re mashing out, heat 0.75 gallon of water to 170°F (77°C) in a separate pot. Set a large mesh strainer over a third pot, 12 qt. Cambro, or other large vessel and pour the mash through the strainer to separate the wort out from the spent grains. Slowly pour the sparge water over the spent grain until you’ve collected about 5.5-6 qt. (5.2-5.7 L) of wort.
Pour the wort into a pot and bring to a boil. Watch closely, as boil-overs can happen. Add the 60-minute hop addition once the wort comes to a boil. With 15 minutes remaining, add the second hop addition, and at the end of the hour-long boil, add the final hop addition.
Chill the wort down to the recommended yeast-pitching temperature by placing the entire pot into an ice bath in your sink. When the wort has reached the appropriate temperature for yeast pitching, transfer it to a clean, sanitized fermentation vessel. Make sure that anything that touches the wort from this point on is sanitized.
Add the yeast to the wort, close the fermentation vessel, and shake it vigorously on and off for about 45 seconds to create it. Run a blow-off tube from the fermenter to a jar or a small pot filled with sanitizer. This will prevent air from entering the soon-to-be beer but will all CO2 to escape.
Within 12-24 hours there will be a decent amount of bubbling that will quiet down after about 3-4 days. Once this happens you can replace the blow-off tube with an airlock. Two weeks later, fermentation will be complete and you can package your beer in bottles or a keg.",

Access this issue along with the archives with Zymurgy Online!
AHA member Marshall Bishop loves Tree House Julius so much that he has devoted untold hours to developing a faithful homebrew clone, the recipe for which he has kindly shared with us. Marshall offers helpful advice for brewing this recipe.
Water chemistry, a specific combination of yeasts, plus acids and essential oils from the hops combine to give this beer its hazy appearance. Tree House doesn’t use flaked grains.
Minimizing calcium in the brewing water contributes a soft mouthfeel. Hard water ions such as magnesium and calcium can contribute chalky, thick sensations – if you want softness in a beer, start with soft water. Using canning salt (sodium chloride) provides chloride without adding calcium.
The long whirlpool at 108°F (42°C) extracts and retains volatile hop flavor and aroma compounds that would otherwise evaporate at higher temperatures. You can replace the whirlpool with a hop stand to maximize contact between hops and wort, but you will get the best utilization from constantly stirring during whirlpool.
Dried yeast has sufficient sterols for healthy fermentation, so there’s no need to aerate or oxygenate. You want to stress the yeast enough to encourage ester production. Esters and other complex fruity, yeast-derived flavors match perfectly with the hop-derived fruity flavors and aromas. Resist the temptation to round up the specified quantities of WB-06 and T-58 if you can’t measure less than one gram, as these will dominate the clean strain and add too much farmhouse character.
Pitching warm and then cooling the fermentation encourages ester production while retaining volatile aromatic compounds. You still want some yeast activity when adding the dry hops, more to prevent oxidation than for any biotransformation mumbo jumbo.
Dry hopping in a mesh bag is not recommended. You’ll get better wort contact by letting the pellet hops dissolve and float free in the primary. Cold crashing won’t clear the beer of hop/polyphenol haze, but it will settle yeast.","Ingredients:

For the final episode in the trilogy—Return of the Jedi (1983)—Pop Culture Brews cohost Andrew Sanders crafted a pale ale recipe reminiscent of Endor, the forest moon that is home to the furry and ferocious Ewoks.
Andrew wanted Return of the Jedi Pale Ale to have more piney and earthy hop notes to reflect the forest setting of the final battle between the Rebels and the evil Empire. As a result, Return of the Jedi Pale Ale uses the same grist as A New Hope Pale Ale, but changes the dry hop additions to Simcoe and Chinook for a more West Coast-style hop.

Adding Carafa III, a dark-roasted barley, makes the recipe darker (~45 SRM) and instills some mild roasted notes in the aftertaste.

Disclaimer: Gas in any pressurized environment is a dangerous thing. Check the blowoffs of any pressurized equipment with the supplier before attempting anything outside its design spec.
Keg beer and build the carbonation level to 1.2 vol. (2.4 g/L) of CO2.
Add nitrogen. The method I would recommend for a home setup is to push nitrogen through a carbonation lid (a special lid with a sintered stone) on a Corny keg. Corny kegs can comfortably take 45 psi of nitrogen.
Bring the keg to 2.2 bar (32 psi) or as high as 3 bar (44 psi) if possible and allow the nitrogen to slowly dissolve. This takes some time, and without gas testing equipment, the pour is your only indication.
Pour at a top pressure of 38 psi (2.6 bar) through a creamer nozzle, ideally with nitrogen top pressure so as to avoid any further carbonation pickup. A full pint at 4–6°C (39–43°F) will take 2 minutes to settle and will have 10–15 mm (about 0.5”) of head depending on the shape of the glassware.

Peter Symons created this modern version of an American sparkling ale based on an original recipe dating back to September 6, 1904. 
The origins of American sparkling ale, sometimes called cold sparkling ale (remember: nothing is new!) around the turn of the 20th century, seem to lie in the need for ale breweries to have a product to compete with later beers. 
The original method was to make a blend of stored and mature ale, with lager kraeusen and so to create a brew that to all appearances was lager beer, but of a decided ale flavor and character. This type of ale was served in bottles as well as on draught.
The requirements for Sparkling Ale included; to brew an ale more palatable, good foam stability, palate-fullness, sparkling to the eye, chill proof, with an appreciable fineness of flavor and aroma of hops and malt, and the characteristic esters of top fermented beers. ","Ingredients:

This series takes a deep dive into commonly held brewing beliefs in pursuit of reaching a verdict on their plausibility. 
“Bush telly” is Aussie slang for a campfire or for looking at the stars while sleeping in your swag (a kind of Australian bivvy bag). Featuring Aussie Galaxy and Eclipse hops, this modern take on the good, old thirst-quenching, highly drinkable Australian sparkling ale, very dry and highly carbonated, will have you looking at the stars. It will also allow you to test how pH can affect perceived bitterness, which is one of the reasons why the IBU scale is not helpful for gauging beer bitterness.
To test this impact, you just need to brew the recipe once and then do a triangle test between the original beer and the same beer with the addition of either phosphoric or lactic acid to reduce the pH by at least 0.2 points. To do this, we suggest serving two pitchers of the beer and adding the acid to one of them, drop by drop, until the pH drops, for example, from 4.3 to 4 or 4.1. Once achieved, do the triangle test to assess which beer feels more bitter. It’s the same base beer with the same IBUs and even the same IBU/OG ratio. The only change is the final pH.
If you can’t get your hands on Eclipse hops, Enigma is a good substitute from Australia. Or, stick with the celestial theme by substituting Ekuanot (formerly known as Equinox) or Comet. If Super Pride hops are hard to come by, try swapping in Centennial.","Ingredients:

This is a variation on my silver-medal-winning recipe from NHC 2021, Sticky Fingers. This year’s variation, a rose saison, is named for a dear family friend who is also a strong female scientist with some French ancestry.
Treat Denver water using one Campden tablet per 20 gal (75.7 L) to remove chloramine. Strike with 1.5 L of 158°F (69°C) water per pound of grist and mash at 148°F (64°C) for 45 minutes. Add 5.2 stabilizer at 1 Tbsp. per 5 gal. of mash water. No mash out. Continuous sparge at 170°F (77°C) to achieve lower body.
The flameout addition of the grape extract will lower wort to whirlpool temperature and extract some good aroma and flavor from the 2-minute hop additions. Chill to 72°F (22°C), and immediately pitch a 1.5 L starter. Package at day 14–21, when fermentation is complete and beer has cleared. It is essential to bottle condition. Re-pitch with a half packet of champagne yeast and dextrose to achieve 2.4 vol. (4.8 g/L) in the bottle. This beer is best weeks 10–24.",

The winning entry was a blend of seven beers. The recipe provided here is the bulk of the blend. My approach is to make several sour stock beers, age them 6 months or so, brew/ferment some fresh saison for the blending day, and then blend to balance/taste prior to adding any adjuncts.
My sour stocks finish so sour that I often need a considerable portion of non-sour beer to balance it out. I aim for final pH of 3.4–3.5 (definitely trying to avoid anything lower than 3.2), so I often shoot higher than that prior to adding fruit, as fruit may lower the pH even further.
Prior to adding fruit, this beer was a 10:1:1:1:1 blend of the Nelson Saison recipe provided here (pH 4.05, FG 1.005), a rye sour (pH 3.25, FG 1.004), two blond sours (pH 2.96, FG 1.004 and pH 2.89, FG 1.003), and a spontaneous sour (pH 3.2, FG 1.003). This blend resulted in a pH of 3.5 before the fruit addition.
I racked about 3 gal. (11.4 L) of this blend onto 17 lb. (7.7 kg) of fresh farmers market peaches (four different varieties, frozen, then thawed prior to adding) to achieve about 5 gal. (18.9 L) total. After six weeks on fruit, the beer pH had risen to 3.7, so I blended in some new blond sour stock and some sour stock that had aged on 4 cumaru seeds per gal., at a ratio of 1:.25:.25 to reach a bottling pH of 3.4 (the seeds had been crushed and soaked in Amburana-barrel-aged cachaça for a few weeks prior to being added to the sour stock). Using the Rare Barrel’s terminal acid shock starter method, this beer was then bottle conditioned with corn sugar in thick brown Belgian bottles to achieve 3.3 vol. (6.6 g/L) CO2. The beer was about 6 months old in the bottle when it was judged.
Making the Nelson Saison: Single infusion mash at 147°F (64°C) for 60 minutes. Target a mash pH of 5.4 and post-boil pH of 5.05. Begin open fermentation (foil on carboy, etc.) at 65°F (18°C), then after 3 days of active fermentation, slowly rise to 75°F (24°C) over the course of several days. Add sugar addition when beer is about 75% fermented (approximately 1.015 SG) and install airlock for remainder of fermentation.
Making sour stock: Sour stock is fairly forgiving. I typically do a 60/40 blend of Pils (or pale malt) and wheat malt, shooting for an OG of 1.045–1.052 and about 4 IBUs. Pitch any Saccharomyces strain and a sour culture blend (and possibly some additional Brettanomyces). The sour stocks used in this beer relied mostly on Bootleg Biology and Yeast Bay sour blend cultures. Fill carboy nearly to the brim with chilled wort, pitch entire mixed culture into primary, wait 6 months (without opening the carboy), then proceed to blending session. Do not let oxygen touch this beer until blending day (brew day oxidation is okay, though). Dump any beers that are acetic or failed to ferment (this should be very rare if you follow the directions here).
A note on the cumaru: I did not mention the cumaru in my NHC entry notes, as I was afraid judges would not know enough about the ingredient, and knowing about it might throw them off. The entry was entered as ‘33C – Wild Specialty (28C): aged w/Peaches.’ The cumaru accented the peaches nicely, making the beer even “peachier” to my palate.",

I prefer working in percentages where possible—the grist for this recipe is 78% Pilsner malt, 20% flaked wheat, and 2% sugar. I’m a huge fan of low-oxygen brewing, reducing hot-side aeration where possible, and being gentle as possible throughout the brewing process. This produces the cleanest, brightest beer possible.
I start by de-oxygenating all my brewing liquor by boiling the entire amount first, then cooling it down to my mash strike temperature. I treat the entire brewing liquor with all minerals (mash and sparging water together) to a 1:2 ratio of sulfate to chloride after the de-oxygenating boil, but before cooling. Do not exceed 100 ppm chloride.
Acidify all of the brewing liquor using lactic acid to achieve a mash pH between 5.1 and 5.3. Mash for 45–60 minutes at 145–147°F (63–64°C). Mash pH should fall between 5.1 and 5.3, but add additional acid if the pH is above 5.3. Gently vorlauf for 20 to 25 minutes or until runoff is very clear. Sparge until the full volume is achieved in the kettle, stop sparging if gravity falls below 1.010, and top up the kettle with excess brewing liquor to achieve the full boil volume.
Boil for 90 minutes. At 60 minutes add the CO2 hop extract, targeting 30 IBUs. After the boil, cool the wort down to 170–160°F (77–71°C). Add the remaining hops, shooting for roughly 1 oz./gal. (7.5 g/L). Whirlpool the hops and let the hops and trub settle for 25–30 minutes. Cool the wort to 67°F (19°C) and rack into the fermenter.
Oxygenate the wort at 1.5 L/min for 1 to 2 minutes with pure O2. Pitch one pack of Rustic Imperial yeast or Wyeast 3726 Farmhouse Ale Yeast for 200 billion or 1.04M cells/mL/°P. Hold temperature at 67–70°F (19–21°C) for first 24 hours, then let the fermentation free-rise to 95–100°F (35–38°C). Hold that temperature until fermentation is complete. Near the tail end of the fermentation (around 1.010/2.6°P or so), attach a spunding valve. Crash cool and condition for 1 to 2 weeks at 32°F (0°C). Force carbonate to 2.7–3 vol. (5.4–6 g/L) of CO2.",

Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 60 minutes, targeting a mash pH of 5.4. Sparge to hit pre-boil volume appropriate for 90-minute boil. Run off one extra gallon (3.8L) into a second pot or kettle; start a side boil on this pot to transform the wort into a melanoidin-rich malt syrup—without scorching!—and add back to main boil.
Add plenty of oxygen, pitch a large yeast starter, and ferment for the first 3 days at 62°F (17°C). After 3 days, warm fermenter to 68–70°F (20–21°C) for a diacetyl rest. Then rack to a rum barrel to sleep for 6 months or until desired character is achieved.
Meanwhile, prepare two infusions in two Mason jars: one of cassia cinnamon and vodka and another of three scrapped, chopped Madagascar vanilla beans and vodka. Let those jars get happy while the beer ages. Dose your racked beer to taste, about 30 mL each per 5-gallon keg.",

I grew up in Northern California and my first Craft beer experience was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

Tha CommUNITY American Lager was contributed by April Dove, a homebrewer in South Carolina, using her brewing education to make a difference in the brewing community.
In 2021, Dove (also known as The Traveling Hoptista) started a multi-brew initiative to offer a more diverse and inclusive taproom experience throughout the tri-county Charleston region. These efforts led her to release an American lager (Tha CommUNITY) in partnership with Holy City Brewing and become the first Black woman to do so.
Her career highlights not only include brewing a flavorful and inclusive beer but for the City of North Charleston to recognize October 1st annually as Tha CommUNITY Day. April loves what she does and hopes to diversify the palate of her community “one beer at a time”, follow her at @thacommunity.brew.
This simple and delicious American lager is an approachable first step into lagering since the temperature can easily be achieved with something like a cold water bath, towel, and fan.","Ingredients:

What’s significant to you about this homebrew recipe?
Barleywine is one of my favorite beer styles. This was my first homebrew recipe to win a medal in a homebrew competition. Over the years, I’ve won a handful of awards with this recipe.
The finished beer is a beautiful deep-red color and has a rich dark cherry and caramel flavor. It finishes with moderate alcohol warmth. Although I consider barleywine a year-round option, it’s the perfect beer to brew in the late summer and let mellow for a few months to break out on that first cold weekend of the year.
This barleywine recipe is also very forgiving and an excellent basis to experiment with different hops and specialty malts. I brew it a little differently each time, depending on what hops I have on hand and what brewing equipment I’m using.
Tell us about homebrewing this recipe!
It’s an adventure in fitting all of the grain into the mash tun each time I brew it. Homebrewing requires a certain degree of flexibility! The first time, the mash tun was filled to the brim and even overflowed a little bit.
The next time I brewed the recipe, I brewed 15 gallons destined for a bourbon barrel, so the recipe was divided into three 5-gallon batches, which made for a long brew day. I somehow forgot to add some of the grain to the second batch, but I was able to make up the loss of gravity with DME (dry malt extract) I had on hand—a technique I learned on the fly.
The last time I made it was with new homebrewing equipment (a Brewzilla), and I discovered almost too late that all of the grain would not fit into the vessel. I decided to employ the reiterative mashing technique, also known as a poly-gyle (not to be confused with parti-gyle). This technique uses multiple mashes, with the wort from the previous batch being used as the liquor for the next until you hit your target gravity.
About Jen
I began homebrewing in 2014. My boyfriend (now husband) and I shared a love of beer, and he was learning to homebrew from one of his friends. I really enjoy cooking and discovering the “how” behind the “why,” so learning how to make beer was a natural step for me.
We dove straight into all-grain homebrewing, although I’ve done a few extract batches over the years. My very first homebrew recipe was a pale ale bittered with marigolds. I remember it being very bitter, but it was mine, and it came from an idea that I came up with, so I loved it!","Ingredients:

Tony Simmons of Pagosa Brewing in Colorado was up for a challenge in 2012 when he was invited to Big Beers, Belgians, and Barleywines in Vail, Colo. They dared him to create a big beer that had not yet been produced commercially at that time, a double black imperial IPA. The most extreme yet deceptively quaffable IPA they’ve ever crafted, Double Black is not for the faint of heart. It isn’t just dark in color, but it has both distinct hop sensations and black malt flavors. This beer was first featured during the opening reception of the Big Beers Festival in January 2012. It’s said to pair well with pork empanadas.","Ingredients:

Irish red ale can be found on the style scale somewhere between pale ale and a brown ale. Similar to English or Scottish ales’ caramel sweetness, but with a more grainy, bready malt flavor and a very approachable ABV. The deep red comes from the roasted malt – enough to achieve flavor but not enough to morph the beer into a true brown.

First, source a fresh or full rye whiskey barrel. I was able to get a 15-gallon (57-liter) barrel from a local distiller and arrived just as they were emptying it. This batch is based on half of what was needed to fill the barrel, so I brewed it twice.
Mash at 156°F (69°C) for a full body. Pull 1.5 gal. (5.7 L) of first runnings to the boil kettle. Boil this down, stirring continuously, to yield a caramelized syrup. Add the remainder of the wort to collect a pre-boil volume of about 11 gal. (41.6 L) aiming for a finished wort volume of 8 gal. (30.3 L).
Add all the hops at 60 minutes, then a fining agent near the end of boil. Cool, transfer to fermenter, pitch yeast, and ferment at 68°F (20°C).
Brew recipe twice to yield enough beer to fill the barrel. When both batches have completed fermentation, transfer immediately to the freshly emptied barrel. Do not rinse or flush the barrel before use. After 2 weeks, transfer from barrel to kegs and age for 9 months or more. When you remember you have these kegs, sample to taste and put on tap.

This recipe has changed and evolved over the last 5 years, as the beer is in a 15-gallon solera barrel. Usually, I pull 5 gallons and top up with fresh beer every 4 months. A beer from this same barrel won gold in the American Wild Ale category at the 2018 NHC.
This recipe is closest to the more recent additions over the last year. I have increased the IBUs to try and arrest some of the lactic acid production. The bottles that were submitted to the competition this year were several years old.
Step mash from 130°F (54°C) to 158°F (70°C) over the course of 90–120 minutes. Sparge and then boil 2 hours. Chill and ferment with T-58 for 2 weeks in the low to mid 70s °F (low 20s °C).
Transfer to solera barrel and age 3–6 months. Add Brettanomyces to barrel a couple of times per year when transferring beer.
Carbonate high, 3–4 vol. (6–8 g/L) CO2 and age another 2–3 months at cellar temperature, evaluating for tetrahydropyridines (THP), if any. Bottle and age another 2 years for Brett/hop development reminiscent of gueuze.",

Prepare a 1.5 L yeast starter about 2 days prior to pitching yeast.
If you’re not looking to win any competitions, feel free to skip the step mash. It’s a lot of extra work for a fairly minimal gain. But if you want to try out the step mash and don’t have a mash tun with a heating element try a decoction mash.
Mash in at 113°F (45°C) and rest 30 minutes. Use a heating element or decoctions to achieve rests at 135°F (57°C) for 30 minutes, 156°F (69°C) for 30 minutes, and 168°F (76°C) for 10 minutes. The rice hulls add no sugar or flavor, but help to prevent a stuck mash. If you’re not used to brewing with wheat, do not skimp on the rice hulls; they could save you a lot of time. On a Brewzilla, I find I need a full pound (about half a kilogram) of rice hulls to prevent a stuck mash.
Drain mash tun and sparge with 168°F (76°C) water until you have 7 gal. (26.5 L) of pre-boil wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding Tettnang hops at the start of the boil. Add Whirlfloc tablet 5 minutes before the end of boil. Chill wort to 75°F (24°C), transfer to fermenter, and pitch yeast starter. Expect a very active fermentation—use a blowoff tube rather than an airlock. Lower the temperature of the fermenter to 68°F (20°C) when you see signs of activity. Allow fermentation to run for two weeks.
Fermentation temperature control is key to success with this recipe since so much of the flavor comes from the yeast. If you don’t have any special equipment for controlling the temperature, I suggest putting your carboy into a large bucket of water to help stabilize the temperature, like the buckets you use to ice your keg at a party.

Conduct a Hochkurz mash with rests at 144°F (62°C) for 30 minutes, 160°F (71°C) for 45 minutes, and 170°F (77°C) for 15 minutes. Use phosphoric acid to adjust mash pH to 5.3–5.4.
Boil 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Chill the wort as fast as possible and keep as much trub out of the fermenter as possible. For this particular beer, I sent the hot wort through the chiller and back into the kettle through the whirlpool valve. When it got to around 100°F (38°C), I switched to pre-chilled water and was able to crash the beer into the kettle to about 70°F (21°C) while it whirlpooled. Then I let it settle for about 20 minutes and pumped it to the fermenter, leaving a very large amount of trub and hops material in the kettle. You must be very careful not to contaminate the wort when doing this, but for this beer it is very important to have as little trub in the fermenter as possible. I have conicals, so after the beer settled overnight to its pitching temperature of 48°F (9°C) I also dumped a small amount of trub. If you don’t have a conical, consider doing the kettle cooling method.
Fermentation performance is paramount for this beer. This particular batch was a 4th-generation pitch after a series of helles lagers. My yeast collection process is to crash the beer, dump out the bottom layer, collect all of the middle layer and a little of the top layer of yeast, and store it at 35°F (2°C). On brew day, I decant the old beer off of the yeast and add some of the 70°F (21°C) wort without aeration or a stir plate . Since the yeast is cold this usually settles the pitch at the target temperature of 48°F (9°C). I’ll hold it there overnight while the main batch cools to that temperature.
The result is a high kräusen pitch the next morning that’s ready to be added to the main batch. After oxygenating the main batch, I’ll then gently swirl the pitch and pour all of it in, probably pitching more than the recommended 1.5 million cells/mL/°P. I leave any brown or dark-colored yeast stuck to the bottom of the starter flask.
Ramp the temperature from 48°F (9°C) to 62°F (17°C) during fermentation, making your first temperature increase once the beer has attenuated 50% and making temperature bumps at 75% and 90% attenuation milestones. Hold at 62°F (17C) until it passes a forced diacetyl test. I believe that you need to slowly cool lagers and not crash them so that there is still some yeast activity present for lagering. Cool slowly, about 2-3°F (1–1.5°C) per day, down to 33-35°F (1–2°C) and then rack to a purged keg with some Biofine Clear and a floating dip tube. Place it on CO2 at about 10 psi (690 mbar) and wait a month. Undoubtedly, you’ll start drinking it after about a week, but it really does get nice and crisp after a month. This particular batch was judged about 4 months from brew day.",

Recipe courtesy of Peter Terzian of the Brandon Bootleggers Homebrew club.
A homebrew club in the next county to the north opened up its combination fundraiser and competition to other clubs in the area. One of our members had entered it last year and told us about it at a meeting. This year, three members of the Brandon Bootleggers Homebrew Club entered beers.
The competition is called the Iron Homebrewer, maybe because you need an iron gut to drink some of the concoctions that brewers come up with. Each entrant gets a randomly drawn unusual ingredient—I was assigned the best ingredient: barbecue sauce! What better base beer for this ingredient than rauchbier?
The challenge would be to develop a recipe with gentle smoke flavor and the right amount of sauce. My beer must have worked because I received many positive comments, such as “I could drink this all afternoon while I’m grilling” and “This is the best beer you’ve ever brewed!”
I only made 3 gallons because I didn’t want to waste a lot of time and ingredients on a beer that I might have to throw out. Turns out I didn’t make enough! We blew the keg before the event was over, and it was judged in the top 5 of 25 beers!","Ingredients:

What is a “SMaSH” beer recipe?
“SMaSH” stands for “single malt and single hop.” The acronym alludes to the simplistic listing of ingredients in a beer recipe, where only one type of malt and one type of hop are used.
There are many benefits to brewing a SMaSH beer recipe. With having a limited amount of ingredients, you can test your sensory skills to see how a specific hop or malt comes through in a recipe. By building an understanding of what to expect when using certain ingredients, you can make more informed decisions on what ingredients to incorporate in future recipes with more than one malt and/or hop.

This recipe comes courtesy of Mark Rocheleau and Andrew Orr. There are options for homebrewers who live in states where marijuana and/or industrial hemp is legal and want to combine their craft beer with marijuana or hemp for personal enjoyment. This tripel-style, THC infusion combines the golden strong ale mild spice with a pleasing THC tincture.
THC-infused beer can—and very likely will—induce psychoactive effects, which can vary from person to person. Consume these beers responsibly and at your own risk. If you are unsure of what to expect, start with a very small sample and wait a few hours before consuming more.
Editor’s Note: Despite legalization and/or decriminalization of cannabis and cannabis-derived products by many states and the District of Columbia, marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and, thus, federally illegal. The American Homebrewers Association neither endorses nor discourages brewing with cannabis-related products, however homebrewers who do so should remember that such beers are not permitted in the National Homebrew Competition.

Gooding used the brown-skinned variety of ube that’s purple inside. They were cut and roasted at 375°F (190°C) for 60 minutes and then slightly mashed (in the potato sense of the word) and rehydrated with boiling water so they would not absorb much liquid.

Spelt can be a bit hard to track down, but the unique, cracker-like graininess it imparts makes it worth the effort. If you can’t find spelt malt, health food stores often have bags of unmalted spelt available, but if you decide to use unmalted spelt, be prepared to conduct a cereal mash to ensure conversion.
You can make a mixed-culture version of this beer by racking half of the finished beer into a 3-gallon carboy and pitching a sachet of BBXMAD1 (The Mad Fermentationist Blend). Ensure that the beer is stable before packaging (this can take several months, and your mileage may vary).

Named for the city of Leuven—home of Europe’s longest bar counter—this Belgian-style wheat beer recipe explores the historic Leuven white ales that gained popularity in the 1700s. The traditional process of brewing Leuven’s white beer has been described as “hopelessly complicated,” so brewer and author Roel Mulder presents a modern take in his article The Lost White Beers of Belgium.
Expect this slightly-cloudy, pale-colored ale to have a prominent malt character with hints of spice from the yeast and hops. Weighing in just below 3% ABV, this makes for a great session beer.","Ingredients:
MALTS & ADJUNCTS
1.85 kg (4.08 lb.) Pilsner malt
1.63 kg (3.58 lb.) raw wheat
220 g (7.8 oz.) flaked oats
HOPS
30 g (1.1 oz.) traditional European hops
YEAST
Witbier yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 20 L (5.28 US gal.)
Original Gravity: 1.042 (10.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.021 (5.3°P)
ABV: 2.8%
IBU: 10
SRM: 3
Efficiency: 75%","Directions:
To do this the old-fashioned way, divide the grain bill into goedzakken and vetzakken grists. For the goedzakken, take 1.7 kg (3.75 lb.) of malt, 300 g (10.6 oz.) of wheat, and all the oats; the remainder will constitute the vetzakken. The idea is to conduct a fairly standard mash with the goedzakken grist. Then, place the first half of the runnings into the kettle and add the vetzakken grist. Leave this at 70–80°C (158–176°F) for 20 minutes and then boil for one hour. Keep stirring to avoid caramelization.
The remainder of the goedzakken wort is boiled separately with the hops for 1 hour. Filtering might be a problem, so use rice hulls or wheat husks as a filter aid. Another option is the traditional way: push in a basket (I used a plastic basket from a salad spinner), let the wort flow in, and just spoon it out.
Leave the wort to cool in a coolship or similar vessel for natural Lactobacillus inoculation. Combine the cooled goedzakken wort with the cooled wort obtained from the combined vetzakken and goedzakken boiled mash and pitch yeast. Drink fresh, within 3 or 4 weeks after primary fermentation.",
16,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/gordon-strong-american-porter/,Not Found,"American porters have a stronger character than modern English porters (which is true for most American adaptations of traditional English styles). The challenge in making this style is to not have overly burnt flavors dominate, and not have the hops clash with the dark malts.
This version from Gordon Strong (featured in Modern Homebrew Recipes) uses roasted barley instead of black malt, and the hopping includes some orange and apricot flavors.
Sensory Description: Balanced roast with a bready base malt, slightly fruity fermentation character, and earthy hops. Moderately strong with a dry finish, malty and roast aftertaste, and balanced bitterness.
Formulation Notes: Fairly straightforward composition, featuring mostly English ingredients. The base malt and yeast are more neutral than an English version, which lets the specialty malts and hops be prominent. The hop flavor is higher on this version, with the first wort hops providing a woody, earthy note, while the later hops give more apricot and orange notes( which I think plays well with the chocolate and light coffee character). Strength and body are on the higher side. The dry hopping is optional, but I fresh hop character as an extra aroma dimension.","Ingredients:

If you really want to stand out as an American style, you can also use classic hops like Cascade and Centennial late. I normally use Cascade at knockout instead of the 5 minute addition and dry hop with Centennial. With fairly simple grist, this beer is also a good baseline for matching other beer flavors to source ingredients. Look for the deep caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors and adjust the quantities based on what you prefer. I would adjust each of those specialty grains no more than 50% up or down as you experiment. I think this beer is also good with a lower bitterness level (in the mid 20s). I tend to mash a couple degrees lower when making aversion with lower bitterness (like 151°F/66°C). I’ve also made a more session strength version of this, reducing everything proportionally to be a 4% ABV beer and omitting the dry hopping altogether. A stronger 7% version is also good; I sometimes make that version to age."

Mash at 148°F (64°C) for 75 minutes and sparge as usual to collect the full pre-boil volume. Bring wort to a boil, or at least to 180°F (82°C), just to sterilize. Chill wort to 110°F (43°C). Check pH and gravity, and add lactic acid, if needed, to reduce pH to 4.5 for safety.
Decant the Goodbelly juice and pitch the Lactobacillus sediment into the wort. Keep this wort around 90–100°F (32–38°C) for two days for souring to take place. After two days, measure pH and gravity. The gravity should not have changed much, but the pH should have fallen into the low 3s (ours fell to about 3.3). The soured wort should have a clean sour, grassy smell. If it smells like vomit, it’s been infected with something else and you may need to dump it.
Bring the soured wort to boil and add hops and spices at indicated times. Chill to 70°F (21°C), move to fermenter, and pitch US-05.
As fermentation wraps up, thaw and refreeze the mango two or three times to help break down the fruit cell walls. When fermentation is complete, add the thawed mango and let it sit in the fermenter for five days.
Cold crash for two days and ensure fruit has settled at the bottom of the fermenter before packaging.",

The mash program is quite complex and best reproduced as the timetable Olavi uses on the day.
6:00 a.m.: Mix grist with lukewarm water but not too much.
7:30 a.m.: Add slightly warmer water to the mash.12:00 p.m.: Add more hot water, this time bringing the mash to 58°C (136°F).
2:00 p.m.: Transfer mash to kettle and start heating it by fire, while stirring constantly.
2:50 p.m.: Stop heating when the surface of the mash is covered in foam and grains start rising to the surface in little spurts. The temperature at the center should be 80°C (176°F).
Originally, Olavi used juniper and straw as the filter bed support for the lauter tun but nowadays he uses only a fine steel mesh.
Transfer the hot mash to the lauter tun. Start running off and, as long as the wort is not clear, pour it back on top to be filtered again. Add hot liquid as necessary to get enough wort.
Cool the collected wort to 22°C (72°F), then pitch yeast together with the handful of hops. Ferment for 3 days. Ferment to the point where you can make a furrow through the foam on the fermenting beer and the furrow does not close again quickly.
Olavi also makes small beer by running off more wort after he’s lautered the main beer. For 25 liters (6.6 gal.) of main beer, you would get about 3 liters (3.2 qt.) of small beer."

We all have much to do ahead to bring awareness to and eradicate systemic racism, but one small step we can all take right now, together, is to support the Black is Beautiful initiative.
Imagined by Marcus Baskerville, founder and head brewer at Weathered Souls Brewing in San Antonio, Texas, the Black is Beautiful initiative is a collaborative effort amongst the brewing community and its customers, to bring awareness to the injustices that many people of color face daily. Its mission is to bridge the gap that has been around for ages and provide a platform to show that the brewing community is an inclusive place for everyone of any color.
More than 1,200 breweries from 50 states and 22 countries have signed on to support the project and brew Black Is Beautiful, a moderately-high ABV stout.

Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C). Hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes.

Grind unmalted wheat berries in malt mill until the consistency of grits; this takes approximately four passes through. If in need of aged hops, ask your local shop if they have any “expired” hops. They are also available through online retailers. In a pinch, bake in the oven spread out on parchment paper at 160°F (71°C) for 6 hours. Create yeast starter the day prior to brewing. Add 2 gallons (7.57 L) of water to milled wheat and bring to a boil to gelatinize the wheat. Boil 15 minutes while stirring constantly. Cool to 166°F (74°C) by adding approximately 2.5 cups (591 mL) cold water and stirring. Add 0.75 lb. (340 g) two-row and 0.75 lb. (340 g) six-row malt and add to mash tun. Let rest for 1 hour. Add remaining malt and rice hulls and 1.25 gallons (4.73 L) of 175°F (79°C) water and mash another hour. Sparge with enough 190°F (88°C) water to bring it to 7 gallons (26.5 L). This will help to avoid a stuck sparge, and husk tannin extraction is a minimal concern due to the use of the huskless berries. Additionally, any husk-derived compounds extracted from the malt will be consumed by Brettanomyces over the years. Add hops and boil to reduce volume to 5 gallons, approximately 1.5 to 2 hours depending on your equipment. This length of boil should eliminate any cheesy flavors from the aged hops. To maintain oxygen exposure, an actual barrel is preferred over a glass carboy, but oak spirals/chips can be used if necessary. Rack to barrel or carboy and ferment at 65°F (18°C). Age in barrel for up to three years. Tartness from the lambic cultures in the blend will develop by 18 months. Bottle using 5 ounces (140 g) of corn sugar to prime. Beer continues to improve in the bottle indefinitely.",

This recipe was provided courtesy of Roel Mulder. When in the 1990s the Bosteels brewery was developing a three-grain beer, they came upon a 17th century brewing record from the Discalced (“shoeless”) Carmelite monastery in the nearby town of Dendermonde. They used it as an inspiration for their now world-famous Tripel Karmeliet.
Here’s Roel's interpretation of the original recipe for the Carmelites’ “Good Beer” from approximately 1679–1689. The original monastery was closed in 1796 and subsequently demolished. It is now the site of a courthouse.","Ingredients:

The original brewing record is rather concise. It is “an instruction to brew 16 barrels of good beer,” for which were used 12 vats of wheat, 36 vats of barley, and 6 vats of spelt or “short oats,” along with 40 pounds of hops. There’s no indication of what was malted and wasn’t, but from common practice at the time it can be concluded that the barley was malted and the wheat was not. At Villers abbey, some of the spelt was malted and some wasn’t. I tried to make the best sense of the quantities indicated, and the result is actually comparable in gravity to that of today’s Tripel Karmeliet. My version is also a bit flattered in the sense of efficiency: probably at the time efficiency was lower and attenuation often wouldn’t go much higher than 50%. Feel free to make adjustments to better approximate the 17th-century original.",

The Mead Mamas even took it a step further and served this recipe as a braggot slushy during the Michigan Homebrew Festival. To recreate the slushies, blend this beer with peach mead (the Mead Mamas used a mead in the 12-14% ABV range) at a beer-to-mead ratio of 1:2 and run the resulting mixture through a slushy machine.","Ingredients:

Dough in at approximately 113°F (45°C) for a 30-minute hydration and beta-glucanase rest. To mitigate subsequent lautering problems, it is also advisable to add about 10% of the dry malt weight in rice hulls at dough-in. After the cytolytic rest, infuse the mash with hot brewing liquor to raise the temperature to 122°F (50°C) for a proteolytic rest of 30 minutes at the peak-performance temperature of protease. Next, raise the mash to 149°F (65°C), the peak-performance temperature of beta amylase. This ensures the production of plenty of fermentables, and thus of alcohol. Allow 30 minutes for this diastatic rest. Repeat the temperature rise a final time to reach the alpha amylase peak temperature of 162°F (72°C). Rest the mash again, this time for 15 minutes, to convert the remaining starches into unfermentable dextrins for extra body in the finished beer. The large grain bill, in conjunction with the many hot-water infusions, is also likely to fill the mash tun to the limit of its capacity. Recirculate the wort thoroughly for perhaps 30 minutes. Then sparge and lauter simultaneously. Use the hot sparge liquor to raise the grain bed temperature to the mash-out temperature of 170°F (77°C). The run-off is likely to be slow! Stop sparging as soon as the kettle gravity is about 1.086 (20.8°P), assuming a 10% evaporation rate during a 90-minute kettle boil. In some mash tun configurations, because of aspect ratios and false-bottom designs, a kettle gravity of 1.086 may not be possible to achieve. In this case, simply sparge until the kettle is full. Then extend the boil until the net kettle gravity of 24°P is reached through evaporation. When weighing out the hop additions, adjust quantities to the projected actual net kettle volume. Boil for at least 90 minutes (or longer if the original gravity at the start of the boil is an issue). Add bittering hops 60 minutes before the anticipated shutdown time. Add flavor hops with 10 minutes of boil time remaining. Add aroma hops 5 minutes before shutdown. Whirlpool and chill. Pitch about twice as much yeast as you normally would for a “regular” brew and aerate well. In our experimental batch, we used 1.5 oz./5 gal. (44 g/19 L) of dried yeast. Primary ferment the brew at the middle of the preferred temperature range of the selected yeast for a total of 3 weeks. At the end of primary fermentation, rack the brew into a clean tank for 7–8 days of secondary fermentation. Prime and bottle the brew. Alternatively, rack the brew into a keg and let it mature for 2 weeks under pressure. Finally, adjust carbonation in the keg to 3.3 to 4.5 volumes (6.6 to 9 g/L) of CO2 before dispensing it unfiltered from the keg.",

“The recipe is inspired by a strawberry milkshake IPA that my fellow beer nerd brother-in-law shared with me from Tired Hands Brewing Co. I was blown away by it. Throughout the ensuing months, I drafted up several milkshake IPA recipes using different fruits such as strawberry, blueberry, and peach.

An interpretation of the recipe given by Georges Lacambre in his reference work Traité complet de la fabrication des bières et de la distillation. I have replaced the 6 to 8 hours of boiling with an addition of some dark malt.
Little is known of the original yeast profile: the historical 60 to 63 percent attenuation seems poor to our eyes, but for its day, this beer was relatively well attenuated. A saison- or Brett-like profile seems appropriate, but to get that historical flavor, try to keep attenuation low by creating more unfermentable sugars in the mash. This helps simulate the fairly uncontrolled conditions that would have been found in a traditional Belgian brewery.","Ingredients:

Another option is the traditional way: push in a basket (I used the plastic basket from a salad spinner), let the wort flow in, and just spoon it out. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

This is my interpretation of an early Dutch imitation of fresh Liège beer, from the city of Dordrecht. In Holland, spelt wasn’t often used in beers, but for Liège beer they made an exception.

Recipe by Terje Raftevold, adapted by Stan Hieronymus and the editors of Zymurgy
This version of raw ale is brewed north of the Jostedalen glacier in western Norway in the three traditional districts Sunnfjord, Nordfjord, and Sunnmøre. Terje Raftevold’s recipe is typical. The name literally means “grain beer,” making it clear how it differs from “beers” made from syrup, juniper berries, and so on. Historically, these beers were brewed from barley, although on the coast the poor would mix in oats when necessary. Today, most people use a mix of 50 percent pale malts and 50 percent Pilsner malts, but there are still a few brewers who make their own malts.
Raw ale wort is not boiled. Because the process has no hot side, brewers must sanitize every bit of equipment that will touch the wort, including the lauter tun. When brewing raw ale, it’s important to have a mash that’s long enough and/or hot enough to properly pasteurize the mash, since there is no boil. The hotter the mash, the shorter it can be, but it’s difficult to be precise about the exact relationship. Adding a hot sparge water infusion at the end of the mash also helps.
Kornøl is always made with a boiled juniper infusion and lautered through juniper. Norwegian farmers use Juniperus communis, which is common in Europe but not in North America. It can be found in Canada and a few places in the United States. The hops can be boiled with a little wort, or the hot wort can just run through the hop bag. In either case, the hop character should be very low and usually not detectable at all. Juniper, rather than hops, balances the flavor. In the glass, these beers look like hefeweizen with no head: yellow, hazy, and opaque with a small coarse head. The aromas are variable, but one should detect boiled juniper, raw ale aromas, strong straw and grain flavors from the malts, and tropical fruitiness from the kveik. The mouthfeel should be full, both from the sugar and from the protein from the raw ale, and also from the kveik yeast. It should also be somewhat mealy from the lack of filtration and the raw character. Carbonation should be low, like British cask ale.
Fermentation time should be two to three days, after which the beer is racked and then stored cool. Alcohol strength is usually 5.3% to 7.6% for the main beer, with final gravities from 1.013 to 1.024. Since the 1990s, quite a few local brewers have begun to boil the wort. Some will boil for an hour, but others boil only 10 to 15 minutes to sterilize the wort.","Ingredients:

Use only the outermost tips on the juniper; don’t use thick branches. Put the juniper in the kettle and boil it for a little while. Take off the juniper infusion for the mashing and let it cool for a while. Mash in at an initial temperature of 165°F (74°C) and mash for at least an hour at 165°F (74°C). The lauter tun filter should be juniper branches. Run off the wort through a bag containing the hops, cool the wort, and transfer to the fermenter. Add hot juniper infusion as necessary. Ideally, lautering should be very slow—if not, you may want to extend the mash by an hour. Traditionally, one should start the yeast with the first wort (which is also the strongest) and then pitch the starter after a few hours. With a rapid, modern lauter this can be difficult, in which case creating a yeast starter from dried malt extract (DME) may be a good alternative. Cool the wort to 86°F (30°C) and pitch the yeast. Insulate the fermenter to assure a high fermentation temperature: 95°F (35°C) is just fine. Top harvest the yeast after 40 hours, and rack after 48 hours. Target an original gravity of 1.075 with a final gravity of 1.018 after 40 hours for a resulting 7.5% ABV. Cellar the beer cold to stop fermentation.",

May 1st is a bank holiday in Germany (Labor Day), and May is very often a transition month from the cold winter to a warmer spring in Bavaria. The same is true for a well-brewed Maibock, or heller bock. It is a real bock, i.e. a strong beer, but it is brewed with an eye to high drinkability. With its pale color, it is not as rich and malty as its darker brothers and sisters, which are typical for fall and winter in Bavaria. With high drinkability and an alcohol content of 6.3 to 7.4% ABV, heller bock can be quite a “dangerous” beer.","Ingredients:

Heat 21.5 qt. (20.3 L) water to 104°F (40°C) and mash in the 13.8 lb. (6.3 kg) grist. This should lower the temperature to about 100°F (38°C). Let the mash rest for 30 minutes. Take about one-third of the mash as the first decoction. Use Dickmaische, which is the part with grist that settles at the bottom of the mash tun, heat it to 151°F (66°C), and rest for 20 minutes. After the rest, heat the decoction further to 162°F (72°C) for a 15-minute rest before you bring the decoction to a boil. Don’t forget to stir while heating. After a 15-minute boil, reunite the decoction with the remaining mash. Again, don’t forget to stir to avoid local overheating and enzyme destruction. The mash should now have a temperature of around 151°F (66°C). Rest for 10 minutes. Again, remove one-third of the mash from the mash tun. This time use Dünnmaische, the part with less grist, which will collect in the upper portion of the mash tun. Heat the decoction to 162°F (72°C) while stirring. Rest for 10 minutes before you bring the decoction to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes and reunite the mash in the mash tun while stirring. The mash should now reach around 162°F (72°C). Rest for 15 minutes and check saccharification with an iodine test. Heat the mash to 172°F (78°C) and hold a mash-out rest for about 10 minutes before you start lautering. Sparge with 172°F (78°C) water until the wort is diluted to a gravity of around 1.057 (14°P) in the kettle. Heat up for a 90-minute boil. Add 0.7 oz. (20 g) Magnum 30 minutes after the wort starts to boil. Add 0.4 oz. (10 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh 75 minutes into the boil. Add the last 0.7 oz. (20 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh 5 minutes before you finish the 90-minutes boil. Your wort should now have a gravity of 1.068 (16.5°P). Cool wort to about 48°F (9°C) and pitch the yeast. Let the temperature rise to about 50°F (10°C) and wait until the beer reaches a gravity of about 1.018 (4.5°P), before you transfer it to a secondary fermenter. Let the beer ferment under a top pressure of 16 psi (1.1 bar) for another 2 weeks before you cool it to about 32°F (0°C). Allow the beer to mature for at least another 5 weeks. If you bottle condition your brew, pitch at 48°F (9°C) and let the temperature rise to 50°F (10°C). Wait until the gravity doesn’t change for at least 3 consecutive days before you transfer the beer to your filling bucket. Add sugar for a carbonation of 4.5 g/L (if you ferment at 50°F/10°C, this should be 4.5 g sugar per liter).","“Earl’sches” Variation
This beer can be also brewed using Earl’s decoction process.
Split the grist into a 9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) portion and a 4.3 lb. (2 kg) portion. Prepare two portions of water with 10.4 qt. (9.8 L) each.
Stir the 9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) grist into one of the 10.4 qt. (9.8 L) portions of water. Heat this mash to 149°F (65°C) and rest for 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 162°F (72°C) and rest for 30 minutes. Check for saccharification with an iodine test. When the mash is fully converted, bring it to a boil and boil for 20 minutes.
Add the second portion of the water to the mash. This should reduce the mash temperature to below 149°F (65°C). If not, add more cold water. Stir in the remaining 4.3 lb. (2 kg) grist. Heat the entire mash to 149°F (65°C) and rest for 30 minutes. After the rest, raise the mash temperature to 162°F (72°C) and rest for 30 minutes. When an iodine test shows full saccharification of the mash, heat to 172°F (78°C) and mash out. Begin lautering and follow the remaining instructions above."

From Mike L.: This is my standard sahti recipe, adapted for typical homebrewing equipment. I have refined it based on my tastes, various brewing experiments, and conversations with sahti masters. While not a classic family recipe, it’s a good example of homebrewed sahti today.
I brew this ale with the same gear I use for modern ales, and I have included options for ingredients easily found outside Finland. I have also streamlined the mashing procedure: with a heated mash tun, the brew day can be over in less than five hours.

Mash the malts at 140°F (60°C) for 45 minutes using 1.1 qt. water per pound of grain (2.3 L/kg). If using juniper, mix the branches or berries into the mash. Raise the temperature to 158°F (70°C), and hold 45 minutes, and then raise to 176°F (80°C) for the final 15 minutes. Recirculate until the wort runs clear. Sparge with 176 to 194°F (80 to 90°C) water to collect 5 gal. (20 L). If using an immersion chiller, sanitize it in the hot wort. Chill the wort to fermentation temperature. If using baker’s yeast, dissolve the fresh yeast in a small amount of cold water, or rehydrate dry yeast in 104°F (40°C) water. Pour wort into the fermenter, add yeast, let ferment, and keep at fermentation temperature until the yeast is finishing its work. Depending on the yeast and temperature, this usually takes 1 to 3 days. When the sahti still tastes sweetish but is no longer cloying, lower the fermentation temperature. If unsure about the timing of this transfer, you can check whether the gravity is in the range 1.034 to 1.038 (8.5 to 9.5°P). Cold condition the sahti for 7 to 10 days, and then rack to storage containers. The ale is ready immediately after racking. Store cool at all times.",

Efficiency: 75%","Directions:
Adjust your mill for the average kernel size of your home-malted wheat. My wheat kernels were quite a bit smaller than those of commercial malt, and my first brew with home-malted wheat got too coarse a crush—I got a great sparge but a lousy yield. With subsequent batches, not only did my level of modification improve, but double milling the wheat malt on the finest mill setting gave me much better results without any need for rice hulls. Mash grains for 20 minutes at 125°F (52°C). Raise to 140°F (60°C) and hold 30 minutes. Raise to 152°F (67°C) and hold 40 minutes. It’s probably a good idea to do a starch test to ensure conversion. When it passes, mash out at 168°F (76°C). Fly sparge with 168°F (76°C) water. Boil 60 minutes, adding homegrown hops one hour before flameout. Be sure to take an initial gravity reading. You may not need to add sugar, but if your initial is running low, add cane sugar to the boil as needed to compensate. I got a pre-boil gravity of 1.040 (10°P) and added 12 oz. (340 g) of cane sugar to bring the gravity up to 1.044 (11°P), which gave an original gravity of 1.050 (12°P) after boil losses. Keep in mind that my finishing gravity of 1.007 (1.75°P) is based on using the sugar addition; without sugar, expect an FG closer to 1.010 (2.5°P). Jar up priming gyle or speise 5 minutes before the end of the boil (if using). Chill wort to 64°F (18°C) and pitch a strong starter. Ferment for three days at 64°F (18°C) or until high kräusen, then allow the beer to free rise to 68°F (20°) and hold this temperature until fermentation is complete. Prime with gyle and bottle in sturdy glass bottles. Keep these at 70°F (21°C) for a week or until they begin to clear. Store at cellar temperatures for two weeks.","Extract Version
Not recommended. You will likely need the diastatic power of the full amount of domestic two-row for complete conversion."

Replace 12 oz. (340 g) Dingemans 6°L Cara 8 malt with 10 oz. (283 g) Briess Caramel 10°L malt, replace 8 oz. (227 g) Belgian wheat malt with 8 oz. (227 g) Weyermann wheat malt, and replace 8 oz. (227 g) white sugar with 8 oz. (227 g) Simplicity Candi Syrup plus 6 oz. (170 g) table sugar. Prepare a 750 mL stir-plate starter of White Labs WLP500 Monastery Ale Yeast prior to brew day. Postpone the 30-minute Hallertau hop addition to 15 minutes before the end of the boil.
Conduct a single infusion mash at 149°F (65°C) for 75 minutes at a pH of 5.3, and fly sparge to collect 6.5 gal. (24.6 L) of wort. Add candi syrup and sugar to the hot wort for a pre-boil specific gravity of 1.036 (9°P). Boil 60 minutes, adding hops and spices (remember to add the Hallertau at 15 min. instead of 30 min.), to yield 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of 1.041 (10.2°P) wort.
Chill, oxygenate, and pitch at 64°F (17.8°C). Ferment at 71°F (21.7°C) for 2 days and then at 69–71°F (20.6–21.7°C) until fermentation slows. Raise to 72°F (22.2°C) for a couple of days until specific gravity reaches 1.004 (1°P). Rack to secondary and fine with 0.25 oz. (7 g) Polyclar mixed with 350 mL (12 fl. oz.) boiled water. Hold at 65°F (18.3°C) for one day, and then slowly lower temperature to 35°F (1.7°C) at a rate of about 4°F (2.2°C) per day.
Rack clear beer to a keg and hold at 35°F (1.7°C) under 15 psi (1,034 mbar) for 9–10 days or until carbonated to 3 vol. (6 g/L) CO2. If you can wait, let the beer cold condition for a month in the keg after racking and carbonating. The patient brewer will be richly rewarded with a smooth, bright beer."

If possible, conduct a stepped mash with 20 minute holds at the following temperatures:  122° F, 144° F, 156° F, and 168° F. Alternatively, you can do a single infusion mash for 60 minutes at 156° F and then sparge at 168° F. Continue with a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops and sugar according to the ingredients section. Start fermentation at 72° F, the let the temperature free rise. Don’t panic if temperatures get over 90° F! Biere de Garde yeast can be finicky sometimes and just quit fermenting if you try to cool the temperature. Once fermentation is complete, transfer to secondary. For best results, age your beer in or on red wine oak barrels or oak chips. The touch of red wine character gives the beer a lovely, subtle character that works well with the yeast and hop characteristics. Allow beer to age for at least 8 weeks, perhaps up to 12 weeks, bringing the temperature down to 45-50° F for the last 2-3 weeks. After aging, simply continue with bottling/kegging as usual. Brewer’s note: this beer requires patience and attention to temperature! Sure, let the fermentation temperature go as high as it wants, but then follow the aging program above for the best results. Biere de Garde is a funny yeast to work with, but its results can be beautiful. In fact, this is the perfect beer to brew in December, bottle in February, and drink in March. Cheers!",

Produced with a cultured abbey ale yeast, this beer also benefits from a mixed fermentation of a house wild culture, most likely including Brettanomyces and various Lactobacillus strains. Using the bottle dregs from a Bam Biére to inspire a secondary fermentation in a small oak barrel is probably the best way to recreate this beer at home. The other option is to purchase a mixed culture packet and some oak cubes or spirals and add to the secondary carboy after primary fermentation. Mash 147-149° F (64-65° C). Free rise temperature to 80° F (27° C) and above, do not control temperature during fermentation. Step down to 50-55° F (10-13° C) once fermentation is complete. Bottle condition to high carb levels. Heavy glass bottles must be used, such as a champagne bottle, to protect from explosion. The safer option is to keg the beer in a corny keg. To dispense the beer properly, higher amounts of C02 will be needed to drwa the beer out to limit excessive foaming.",

Crush the base malts as you normally would. If you are using the black malt, mill it separately and finely. The small amount of black malt can improve clarity at the expense of a bit of extra color (around 1 SRM). The flaked adjuncts do not need to be milled. Mix grains and adjuncts and mash in at 150°F (66°C) with 13.5 qt. (12.8 L) of water. Stir the mash every 5 minutes or so if it is possible to do so without losing heat. Take periodic iodine tests and mash out when you receive a negative result. Recirculate the wort until it runs clear or you have recirculated more than 10 qt. (about 10 L). Run off and sparge with water hot enough to maintain a grain bed temperature of 165–168°F (74–75°C). As you run off, do not let the pH of the runoff exceed 5.8. (You may need to collect less than 6 gal./23 L.) Add water, if needed, to the kettle to yield enough wort to achieve 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding bittering (Mosaic) hops for the final 60 minutes of the boil. Add the Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil. After knockout, add whirlpool hops and let steep for 10 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill the wort and transfer it to your fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast from yeast starter. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). When fermentation is winding down, at around 5–6°P (1.020–1.024), add the enzyme. When terminal gravity is reached, rack beer to secondary fermenter containing the dry hops in a mesh bag. Dry hop for 7–10 days, and then prepare a PVPP solution by dissolving the powder in as small an amount of water as you can manage: a couple of ounces (about 60 mL) should be plenty. Remove the dry hops and swirl the beer gently. Without splashing, stir the PVPP gently into the top layer of beer and re-affix the fermentation lock. Let the beer sit for at least 6 hours or overnight before racking to a keg or bottling bucket. Carbonate to around 3 volumes (6 g/L) of CO2.

Learn about Charlie Papazian's endeavor in brewing this recipe with hops grown at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
by Charlie Papazian
After 48 years of brewing, I still enjoy explorations and recreations with homebrewing. I often tell a story about the beers of the first Great American Beer Festival in 1982, which featured 22 breweries pouring 40 beers for 750 attendees. The “microbreweries” that attended that very first year were Boulder Brewing, Sierra Nevada Brewing, River City Brewing, and Anchor Brewing.
The two beers that seem to be the most memorable were brewed by the then Falstaff Brewing Company: Ballantine India Pale Ale and Narragansett Porter. Both were distinguished by brilliant Cascade dry hopping. Both had a perfect foundation of malt character that elevated what I would call “old-school” Cascade hop flavor and aroma.
For those of you who weren’t around in those early days of Cascade hop cultivation, the Cascade hop of today is very different in character than the original cultivars we welcomed as Cascade hops in the early 1980s. A bright conflagration of citrus and pine is one way I recall experiencing it. My homegrown hops cultivated from those original cuttings still maintain those old-school characters.
The interesting thing about the Narragansett Porter is that it was once a regional brand of New England. The brewery faltered and the brand was bought by Falstaff and briefly resurrected for regionally reminiscent beer drinkers. But the version of Narragansett Porter presented at the 1982 Great American Beer Festival was different than the traditional brew of previous brewers and years.
I reviewed the 1982 Great American Beer Festival program (which I still have) and discovered some interesting information about that 1982 beer. The beer that was originally going to be sent and presented at the Great American Beer Festival was something called Ballantine Porter, and that’s what they sent us program information for. When the beers arrived, we discovered that the brewery had changed the name to Narragansett Porter and festgoers were the beneficiaries. It was a dark, medium-bodied porter with a balanced roasted, toasted dark malt flavor. The lightness of corn and a medium malt body accented the flavor and aroma experience of dry-hopped Cascade perfectly.
America’s First Dry-Hopped Beer
According to the program, which was the information given to us by the brewery, “This dark brew uses malted barley, a small amount of corn grits, top fermenting yeast and a blend of Cascade and Bullion hops. Ballantine [actually presented as Narragansett] Porter is dry hopped in storage during transfer from primary to secondary. CO2 is used to reinvigorate the hops later. … The peak for this brew is around 45 days. The alcohol content is over 6% by volume.”
It struck me that this may have been the first modern-day American-brewed beer that was dry hopped. The few existing microbrewers such as Sierra Nevada, Boulder Beer, River City, and Anchor Brewing were more likely late hopping during the brewing stage. I don’t recall that dry hopping in the fermentation/aging tanks had made its way into the process with American microbrewers yet.
I vividly recall that ʼGansett was delicious, and it has become the kind of beer I really enjoy these days. I wanted to recreate it, so I formulated Flubadub ‘Gansett Porter to replicate what I experienced in 1982. It was after I had formulated my recipe that I came across the above description, and to my delight, my recollection jived with the brewery’s description with one exception. My beer is a bit lower in alcohol content, which is where I am at these days.
Bullion hops are very difficult to get, so I substituted German Hallertauer. Their low bitterness and earthy flavors are easy to navigate. You’ll notice I add a touch of homegrown wild Colorado hops. These hops have a sulfur-like onion character and hardly any bitterness value; their IBU contribution to this recipe is only about 3 BUs. My feeling is that a blend of wild hops and Hallertauer can somewhat replicate Bullion’s character.
So, let’s cut the shuck and jive and get on with the recipe.

MALTS AND ADJUNCTS
8 lb. (3.6 kg) Pilsner malt, plus 1 cup (250 mL) for the cereal mash
1 lb. (454 g) flaked corn
8 oz. (227 g) aromatic malt
4 oz. (113 g) black (patent) malt

HOPS
0.75 oz. (21 g) German Hallertauer, 4.5% a.a. @ 60 min (3–4 HBU/95 MBU)
2.5 oz. (70 g) Wild hops, 1% a.a. @ 5 min (2–3 HBU/70 MBU)
1 oz. (28 g) homegrown Cascade, 5% a.a. @ 0 min (5 HBU/140 MBU)
1.25 oz. (35 g) homegrown hops, blended into a powder, dry hop
YEAST
German or Bavarian type lager yeast. Yes, lager yeast. I use my own 35-year old-yeast, which is sold by White Labs as WLP862 Cry Havoc.

A step infusion mash and separate cereal mash are employed to mash the grains. Add 6 qt. (4.3 L) of cold water to 1 cup (250 mL) crushed Pilsner malt and 1 pound (454 g) of flaked corn and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, add 9 qt. (8.6 L) of 140° F (60°° C) water to the remaining crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. After half an hour, add the boiling corn and Pilsner malt to the main mash. Add heat if needed to bring mash temperature up to 155° F (68° C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat, add the 0-minute hops, and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gal. (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop powder for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Partial-Mash Version

To prevent the impression of the beer being “”watered down”” you need to be careful not to collect too much wort through sparging since it’s not boiled for any length of time. No boil. Heat wort until it just starts to boil then turn off heat and chill to ambient temperature. Transfer to a sterilized carboy, aerate and pitch the yeast and bugs. Allow primary fermentation to reach completion and then transfer to a secondary vessel containing the cherry juice (note: the cherry juice adds a half gallon of liquid to the fermented brew and will also impact mouthfeel, tartness and alcohol in the end). Allow enough time in secondary so that any restart in fermentation from the cherry juice subsides. Allow beer temperature to raise and lower as it sees fit. Ambient temperature in cellar was around 65° F. Bottle once all signs of fermentation ceased. Carbonated to approx. 2.5 vol of CO2 with corn sugar (approx. 4oz).",

Yeast notes: Starter created from yeast dregs of several bottles of spontaneously fermented Belgian wild ales and pitched into this 5 gallons batch when approximately 1 quart of yeast cake starter had propagated. Alternative approximation to this methodology would be use of one package commercially available yeast to create approximately a 1 quarter starter. Suggest use of WLP655 White Labs Belgian Sour 1 mix of Omega Yeast OY-212 Brett Blend #3 Bring On Da Funk would be an appropriate method. Mash at 155° F for 1 hour, vorlauf for approximately 5-10 minutes (until wort runs clear). Ensure first wort hops added to boil kettle during wort collection process. Boil for 60 minutes, add hops, whirlfloc tablet and yeast nutrient per schedule. Chill to approximately 75° F after boil and fermented at approximately 65° F for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, add raspberry puree. Sugars in the puree will cause fermentation to restart. Allow beer to age on raspberry puree in fermentater for approximately 1.5 years, rack to secondary and bottle with corn sugar to approximately 2.8 volumes of CO2. Due to the use of commercial beer yeast dregs propagated in a starter, significant time was allotted to allow this beer to develop a complex fermentation profile. If commercially available yeast is used in lieu of creating a starter from bottle dregs, it is likely that 1.5 years may not be needed to develop a complex fermentation profile, suggest a period of 6 months could be used instead. If a shorter time period is used, check gravity before deciding to bottle to ensure all residual sugar from raspberry puree has fermented out.",

Whirlpool with flameout hops for 20 minutes, and then cool. Oxygenate and pitch an adequate amount of yeast (a starter or multiple packages of yeast) according to mrmalty. com. Don’t significantly overpitch. Ferment at 67°F (19°C). After a successful forced diacetyl test, cool the beer to 53°F (12°C) for two days. Dump the yeast and trub, if fermenting in a conical, then add the dry hops, back-flushing with CO2 or bubbling CO2 through the fermenter while adding the hops, if possible. Let the fermenter rise to 67°F (19°C) again during the dry hop. The large dry hop amount will likely add another few points of attenuation. After six days, cool the fermenter to 40° F (4° C) for two days, again dumping hops and remaining yeast, if possible. Fine with 15 mL of BioFine, agitating the beer with CO2 to mix it in thoroughly. Allow the beer to settle and clarify for two days before transferring it to a keg. Try to avoid introducing oxygen into the finished beer as much as possible (e.g. flush transfer lines with CO2 immediately before the transfer, completely seal the fermenter or keep slight positive pressure on the fermenter during the cold crash and perform a closed transfer to the keg).",

This beer was made with a reiterated mash in which wort from the first mash was used as brewing liquor for the second mash. The Maris Otter and half of the specialty grains (except the C20) were first mashed at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes, which was followed by a batch sparge to achieve a total wort volume of 11.37 gal. (43 L). After that, 5.4 gal. 20.4 L) of this wort was heated to 164°F (73°C) and used to mash the remaining grains for a second mash to hit 150° F (66° C) for 60 minutes. The remaining first runnings were heated and used to batch sparge the second mash. The reiterated mash allows you to hit a higher OG when the mash tun size is a limiting factor. It is also said to help enhance the malt flavors. Boil for 120 minutes. Chill to 65°F (18°C). Oxygenate 120 seconds with pure oxygen at 0.5 L/min. Let free rise and ferment at 68°F (20°C) for three days. Then let rise slowly to 71°F (22°C) over two days. Hold for 15 more days. Crash chill to 37°F (3°C) over two days. Keg carbonate to 12 PSI while keeping at 37°F (3°C) for 8 days. The beer was then aged in a cellar environment with slow seasonal fluctuations (mid-40s to mid-60s°F or 7–18°C) for 200 days, bottled, and then kept at 37° F (3° C).",

MALTS
6 lb. (2.72 kg) flaked wheat
4.5 lb. (2.04 kg) Briess pale two-row malt
4 oz. (113 g) flaked oats
HOPS
0.65 oz. (18 g) Amarillo, 9% a.a. @ 20 min
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo, 9% a.a. @ 15 min
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo, 9% a.a. @ 0 min
WATER
Malt-forward (CaCl 75–100% of Ca additions) water profile that is appropriate for your water. Resist the urge to use gypsum to boost hop crispness; this is a round, balanced to malty beer with heavy hop aroma and flavor, not bitterness.
ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS
0.1 oz. (2.8 g) freshly ground coriander @ 5 min
0.1 oz. (2.8 g) freshly ground bitter orange peel @ 5 min

Use BIAB single infusion mash at 152°F (67°C) for 90 to 120 minutes. Stir occasionally, keeping mash between 150 and 152°F (66 and 67°C). Remove bag. Measure gravity, adjust volumes for gravity vs. evaporation rate/boil length if needed to hit target OG of 1.050 and begin boil. It’s very important that you chill immediately and quickly because this is a hop-bursted beer. Delays will cause the beer to be too bitter. Chill to 64°F (18°C), oxygenate and pitch. Fermentation should start low and finish high: let primary free-rise gradually over the course of two weeks, bumping with heat, if needed later in the fermentation, to finish at 78° F (26°C) at the very end. Let sit in primary at 78°F (26°C) for a few days and keg, then chill and carbonate to taste (high level for wit). Ready to drink as soon as it is carbonated. Do not add more coriander or orange peel to the recipe. Let the Amarillo do the heavy orange lifting. Watch your base malt’s diastatic power, too. Briess 2-row has worked for me, but other malts might have issues fully converting so much adjunct.",

In the early days of lager brewing outside its traditional central European home, several regional Bavarian styles were imitated abroad. One of these was Kulmbacher.
Even Heineken used to brew this style of strong, hoppy, very dark lager. But for some reason it quickly fell out of fashion and is today virtually unknown as a style. Which is a shame as I’m sure its bold flavors would go down well with modern drinkers. You could think of it as a Münchener on steroids.

This Bavarian method of decoction is taken from from Handbuch der Chemischen Technologie: Die Bierbrauerei by Dr. Fr. Jul. Otto, published in 1865, page 128. As soon as the water in the kettle reaches 50º C, as much as is needed is put into the mash tun to dough in. After an hour, when the rest of the water has come to the boil in the kettle, this is added to the mash. The temperature of the mash should be 53.75–56.25º C [128.75–133.25° F]. A small amount of water should remain in the kettle so that the temperature of the mash is correct. Or a small amount of cold water is added to the mash. When, after resting, the wort in the mash tun has cleared, this is run off and boiled in the kettle. After just a few minutes boiling, this lauter mash is added back to the tun and mashed for 45 minutes. The temperature of the mash should be 71.25–72.5º C [160.25–162.5º F]. Usually a small quantity of wort is left in the kettle and boiled with all the hops for 10 to 12 minutes (Hopfenrösten). The mash in the tun is left to rest for 90 minutes, then it is drawn off and added to the kettle where it interrupts the Rösten. The wort from the first lot of cold water poured over the grains is usually used for topping up the kettle. Boil wort 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Chill wort to 48° F (9° C) and pitch yeast.",

The main difference of Augsburger beer lies in the process of how it was made: instead of following the typical Bavarian decoction mash, historic sources describe a unique method that was only practiced in this form in Augsburg.
In addition to the different approach to mashing, the beer was also treated differently when filled into casks: as in other parts of Bavaria, the wooden casks in Augsburg were pitched. But while in other regions the pitch was allowed to cool down, in Augsburg the beer was filled into the casks when the pitch is still burning hot. This was said to give the beer of Augsburg its peculiar flavor that distinguished it from the rest of Bavaria.

Sour American red ale
The souring range of 113–115° F (45–46° C) should focus the souring efforts on native bacteria that give a cleaner sourness with some esters and a bright finish. The higher finishing gravity is crucial to help balance the higher levels of sourness and bitterness, as drying out the beer too much will yield a harsher finish. This beer uses two ale strains to yield a slightly elevated final gravity with some estery English character. The balance between final gravity, IBUs, and titratable acidity can help balance your sour beer’s “perceived sourness.”

238,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/the-charlie/,Not Found,"Ask any professional brewer how they got started and chances are they’ll mention a homebrew kit.
Kevin Ryan had just that sort of beginning when his fiancée Meredith gifted him a beermaking kit for Valentine’s Day. That kit was the seed that would eventually flourish into Service Brewing Company in Savannah, Georgia. Today, Kevin and Meredith brew and serve craft beer to thirsty patrons while also raising awareness and support for our nation’s veterans and first responders, a cause very important to Kevin who is a West Point graduate and former Army commander.
To celebrate their homebrew roots during American Craft Beer Week 2018, the Service Brewing crew decided to brew a beer in honor of the man who helped guide Kevin down the path of beer making: our own Charlie Papazian! Charlie’s book The Complete Joy of Homebrewing was one of the first brewing books Kevin cracked into, and it kick-started his journey into the world of professional brewing.
The recipe, aptly named “The Charlie,” is a citrus pale ale (CPA… Charlie Papazian… get it?) with a hefty dose of hops and an addition of pink guava. This hop-forward ale will satiate even the hoppiest of hop-heads, and the pink guava puree adds a little extra somethin’-somethin’ to keep your palate excited. And, of course, this recipe includes a hefty helping of relaxation, since Charlie would have it no other way!
Service Brewing Company will tap and pour The Charlie during American Craft Beer Week 2018 (May 14–20, 2018). Find out more about American Craft Beer Week on CraftBeer.com.

239,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/13th-day-imperial-stout/,Not Found,"With a little over a year of brewing under her belt, Canadian homebrewer Chelsea Tessier came out on top in the 2018 Roxy Memorial Iron Brewer competition for her 13th Day Imperial Stout recipe. ""I was on my thirteenth day of 18-hour shifts, and I was exhausted,"" Tessier laughed when asked about the curious name.
The competition is held annually by the Edmonton Homebrewers Guild (EHG) and is named in honor of late EHG member Roxy Hastings. Hastings was known for homebrewing “imperial” versions of just about every style, so the competition fittingly focuses on high-gravity homebrew.
Despite being new to the scene, Tessier has dived into homebrewing headfirst, racking up multiple medals in BJCP-sanctioned competitions, and even remodeling her kitchen to fit her homebrew needs. Shortly after being bitten by the pesky “homebrew bug,” Tessier began modifying her kitchen to make it more conducive to brewing. First it was replacing the microwave with a hood fan. Then it was resurfacing the counter tops that became battle-scarred from brew days.
It culminated with a brand new stove, after the old one took a beating. “All in the name of brewing,” Tessier shares.
By day, Tessier is a microbiologist working for an environmental company performing exotoxicology work (testing live aquatic organisms for toxicity in effluent samples). This background in science fuels a lot of Tessier's interests in mastering the art of making beer at home. “There are infinite amounts of knowledge to be learned and put into practice, so I never find myself getting disinterested in homebrewing,” she shares.

Mash at 68° C (154° F) for 60 minutes. Note on Chelsea’s process: Chelsea does a single infusion, no-sparge mash with a brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) setup. For this recipe, she started with 32 L of water to end up with a 24 L batch. 4.3 g of baking soda was added to increase the pH of the mash since the large amount of roasted barley drives down the pH. The water in Edmonton is relatively hard, so no other adjustments were needed. A week-old yeast cake from a previous batch of homebrew was used. Future Variations: Chelsea plans to brew a variation of her 13th Day Imperial Stout recipe with more aroma and bittering hops and an English variety of yeast like Whitbread.",

In 2009, Drew Beechum, along with some of his fellow members of the Maltose Falcons, got together to compete amongst themselves to create ""something wild"" in memory of a friend who experimented with home-smoked malts. Thirty Falcons took Beanie's malt and promised to make something interesting. Drew's recipe was fueled by Thanksgiving dessert with hopes of imitating the taste of a dark, nutty, caramel flavor with a hint of smoke. The Southern Highlander sees about 3 hours of boil time, making it rich and full-bodied. This wee heavy certainly mimics a pecan pie's brown sugar syrup with the dose of maple syrup during secondary fermentation.

Rice is sometimes considered a cheap filler ingredient only suitable for American adjunct macro beers and the Japanese lagers found at your neighborhood sushi haunt. But historical precedent, at home and abroad, and modern recipes crafted with rice are proving that the adjunct can be a valuable ingredient in a variety of styles–—its contribution to light lager doesn't necessarily have to be the result of large-scale economics.
Rice can hold its own as a valuable addition to a number of beer styles. Rice obviously isn't a traditional ingredient in a Belgian tripel, but sugar adjuncts are. If you think of rice as light sugar adjunct, it makes sense in a tripel and creates a unique take on the style.","Ingredients:

Day 1: Prepare yogurt starter (multiple slower lacto strains) 2 days before brew day. Make 2 liters of 1.020 starter wort, cool to 100°F (38°C) and drop in 2 tablespoons Nancy’s plain nonfat Greek yogurt. Add a pinch os yeast nutrient and 0.5 teaspoon lactic acid to lower pH closer to mid 4s. Use an airlock and stopper. Swirl gently a couple of times a day. Keep culture on a heating pad to maintain about 100°F (38°C) for 2-3 days. Day 3: Mash in at 154°F (68°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Run 7 gallons (26.5 L) into the kettle and boil wort for 5 minutes to pasteurize, turn off heat and chill to 100°F (38°C). Add the yogurt starter to the kettle, 16 oz (473 mL) of mango Goodbelly probiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum), 0.5 tsp yeast nutrient, and 1 tsp lactic acid. Stir, purge air space above inoculate wort with CO2, and seal up the top of the kettle to prevent air ingress. Keep the kettle at around 95°F (35°C) for 3 days. Day 7: Boil soured wort for 60 minutes. pH should be 3.4, and wort gravity should increase from 1.038 to 1.044. Chill to 75°F (24°C) and rack to fermenter with 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient and saison yeast blend starter. Oxygenate 30 seconds. Fit fermenter with an airlock. Maintain fermenter in the mid 70s°F (23-24°C) for the first day, and then warm the fermenter up to about 90°F (32°C) on the second day. Around the third or fourth day of fermentation, just after high krausen, add 1 lb (0.45 kg) table sugar dissolved in a small amount of boiled water to re-ignite the yeast and boost the gravity. Original gravity with sugar addition should be 1.052. After 7 days of fermenting, rack to secondary on top of 10 lb (4.54 kg) of boiled, cooled raspberries. After an additional 7 days of fermentation, transfer to the serving keg, and force carbonate to 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) CO2. Water: Seattle tap water with 1 tsp gypsum and 1 tsp calcium chloride.",

There are loads of things to think about when you're talking beer and food flavor dynamics, and Charlie Papazian is someone we certainly trust when it comes to identifying beer styles that cut and complement different foods. In his World of Worts column in Zymurgy a few years ago, he highlighted some important points about beer flavor that will inform your food pairing choices. Things to pay attention to when you're building your menu, just to name a few, are acidity, carbonation, the level of roasted character, and bitterness.
Charlie presented this recipe for his Vitoria Vienna Pils, describing it as a beer that reflects the flavors, aromas, and nuanced complexity of even the simplest of recipes. This unfiltered, naturally conditioned German-style Pilsner is a hop flavor- and hop aroma-enhanced lager with subtle toast malt character that will elevate any food accompaniment.

9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) Briess Vienna GoldPils malt
2 oz. (56 g) German Hallertauer hops, 4.4% a.a. (60 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) German Saphir hop pellets, 4.5% a.a. (20 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) German Saphir hop pellets, 4.5% a.a. (dry hop)
0.25 tsp. (1 g) powdered Irish moss

Boil Time: 60 minutes","Directions:
A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 9.5 quarts (9 L) of 140°F  (60°C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132°F (56°C) for 30 minutes. Add 4.75 quarts (4.5 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 20 minutes remain, add the 20-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Transfer the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack  from primary to secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures of 35–45°F (2–7°C) for 3–6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

It celebrates the bonds between America's professional and amateur craft brewers by judging commercially produced beers scaled up from award-winning AHA member homebrew recipes. This Argentine Strong Scotch Ale was originally created by Ron Yabut and was brewed by Elysian Brewing Co. in the 2007 GABF Pro-Am competition. It presents a toasty, sweet malt nose; has a medium-full body; and is malty-sweet in flavor with some pleasant fruity esters.

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 11 qt. (10.5 L) of 140° F (60° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 15 minutes remain, add the 15-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss and zinc fortified yeast. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gal. (19 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at a temperature of about 55° F (13° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. Lager the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (2–7° C) for 4 to 8 weeks.

After hopping from brewery to brewery in Singapore in 2009, Charlie Papazian got inspired to make this damn good oatmeal stout based on his experience at Brewerkz Riverside Point. Charlie assures that any beer lover should make this spot a destination as soon as they hit the ground in Singapore. This version (created by Charlie himself) has a smooth, velvety texture and a creamy brown head. When you put this one up to your nose, you'll get a light cocoa and coffee flavor with subtle enhancement of aroma hops. Just over 4% alcohol by volume, this beer is truly for all seasons and surprisingly refreshing, even in the warmth of summer.

Charlie Papazian has done his fair share of reminiscing about his beer adventures, and—we must admit—they never get old. This recipe comes from an article he wrote in response to a request for more content on sessionable beers. Charlie raved over an English-style bitter he had in Britain that was 4% ABV and exploding with flavor. Spectacularly fresh and relatively low in alcohol, the beer inspired Papazian to produce his own wonderfully complex 4% ABV ale bursting with hop flavor and malt personality. This beer is refreshing, moderately floral, and spicy, with notable malt character that makes having more than one just too easy.

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 11 qt. (10.5 L) of 140° F (60° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 0 minutes remain (when boiling is done), add the 0-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gal. (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week.
Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

SRM: 5.1
Boil Time: 90 minutes
Efficiency: 83%","Directions:
This recipe has been scaled to assume an 83% efficiency (right about what we used to get on our homebrew setup back in the day) and a 2 gal/hour boil off rate.  Please adjust the 2-row base malt according to your setup. Mash at 152° F (66.67° C) for 30-45 minutes (until conversion is complete), target mash pH 5.3. Sparge with 170° F water and collect at least 8.05 gallons (30.47 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil and add kettle hops per the indicated schedule. At knockout, use a large spoon or stirrer and create a whirlpool to cool the wort for a few minutes. The closer you can get to 190° F the better, but anything under 200° F will work. Add the whirlpool hops and let rest 10 minutes, then whirlpool again for a few minutes to create a nice compact trub/hop pile. After the whirlpool period, chill the wort to 68° F, oxygenate, and collect at least 5.05 (19.11 L) gallons of wort. Depending on your efficiency and setup, you can feel free to collect some extra wort to compensate for losses due to dry hopping. When the fermentation is about 1P from FG, add the dry hops. After 3-7 days after FG, crash and rack off of the hops. Carbonate to 2.55 volumes CO2.","Target Water Profile
Use Gypsum and Calcium Chloride to adjust to:
115-125 ppm Calcium
65-75 ppm Chloride
145-155ppm Sulfate
Finished SO4/Cl ratio: 2.3-2.5
Use Lactic Acid (88% strength) to adjust water pH, we use a .55 mL/gal rate, and we adjust both the mash water and sparge water separately (based on the volume of each).  If you do not have the capability to adjust mash and sparge water separately, you may make all of the mineral/acid additions based on your mash water volume. Always use de-chlorinated water."

1 oz. (28 g) German Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, 4% a.a. @ 15 min (4 HBU/112 MBU)
6 10–12 in. (25–30 cm) boughs/branches of juniper for brewing water (the ones I used were laden with green berries). Juniper is not cedar. The needles on these branches were very thorn-like and difficult to handle without gloves.
4 10–12 in. (25–30 cm) boughs/branches of juniper for base water and lautering
1/4 tsp. (1 g) powdered Irish moss
3/4 cup (175 mL) corn sugar (priming bottles) or 0.33 cups (80 mL) corn sugar for kegging
1 cm2 (0.16 in.2) fresh compressed “cake” yeast. Of course you may use lager or ale yeast, but keep in mind this recipe attempts to be true to style.

Boil four boughs of juniper branches in 6.5 gal. (25 L) of water for one hour. After removing the spent branches, use the water for mashing and sparging. A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 8 qt. (7.6 L) of 140° F (60° C) “juniper water” to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 qt. (3.8 L) of boiling juniper water, heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), hold for about 30 minutes, and raise temperature to 167° F (75° C). Place 2 branches of juniper on the bottom of the lauter vessel and lauter and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) juniper water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 15 minutes remain, add the 15-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gal. (18.9 L) with additional cold juniper water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Dissolve the compressed yeast in a small amount of boiled and cooled water. Use a jar and a teaspoon previously sterilized in boiling water to contain and mix the yeast and water. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 65° F (18° C). Ferment at about 65° F (18° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary, and if you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete. Relax. Don’t worry.

Recipe courtesy Marie-Annick Scott, Edmonton Homebrewers Guild
ALES Open Homebrewer of the Year Marie-Annick Scott shares one of her six award-winning recipes from the 2017 ALES Open—Canada’s largest homebrew competition—which was held April 17 to 22 in Regina, SK.
“I made this because one of my brothers can’t drink craft beers,” says Marie-Annick. “It’s a lot more work than most homebrewers would be willing to put in for what you get.”
This recipe is brewed using a process similar to that used by large breweries. You’ll brew a strong lager of 8% ABV, which is diluted to 4% ABV at packaging. This dilution process “minimizes the yeast flavors that you would get from fermenting the full batch volume and will give you that sought-after ‘flavorlessness,’” Marie-Annick notes. A long, multi-step mash program produces the highly fermentable wort necessary to accurately brew this style.","Ingredients:
MALTS
8 lb. 6-row malted barley
6.8 lb. rice flakes
HOPS
0.5 oz. (14 g) Willamette, 5.5% a.a. @ 60 min
0.13 oz. (4 g) Cascade, 5.5% a.a. @ 60 min

IBU: 6
SRM: 2","Directions:
Note: This batch is brewed as 5.5 US gallons (20.8 L) and then diluted to 11 US gallons (41.6 L). Mash in at 100° F (38° C) and hold 20 minutes for an acid rest. Raise mash temperature to 122° F (50° C) and hold for a 30-minute protein rest. Separate mash into thick and thin parts. Raise the temperature of the thick mash to 156° F (69° C), hold for 15 minutes, and then add back to the thin mash. This gives the alpha amylase enzymes a chance to break down the starches without denaturing the beta amylase enzymes in the thin mash. Raise the temperature of the recombined mash to 146° F (63° C) and hold for 2 hours. Mash out and sparge with enough water to achieve a pre-boil gravity of 1.060. Boil for one hour, or until wort gravity reaches 1.070, adding hops, Whirlfloc, and yeast nutrient at the indicated times. Chill wort and transfer to a carboy. Wait 15 minutes for the trub to settle out and then transfer again. Oxygenate for 2 minutes and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50° F (10° C) until kräusen falls, then raise temperature for a diacetyl rest until terminal gravity is reached. Cool to 14° F (–10° C) and hold for 12 hours to allow yeast to flocculate and chill haze to appear before fining with bentonite. Rack and repeat with Polyclar. You now have approximately 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of beer at 8% ABV. Boil another 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of reverse osmosis water for at least 10 minutes to eliminate most of the dissolved oxygen in the water. Chill the water as quickly as possible to avoid oxygen pickup, and then rack your high-gravity beer on to the deoxygenated water. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes (5 g/L) of CO2.",

Bill Schneller thinks the best approach to brewing Belgian beers is to not be a slave to the guidelines. Most Belgian-style beers are yeast driven, with malt and hops playing supporting roles. Schneller says adding fully fermentable sugar to the boil is essential to making a high-gravity beer that's still dry and crisp. This recipe is a great example of how experimenting with malts and hops can still produce a beer that fits loosely into the Belgian guidelines. Flaked oats give it a smooth finish, while noble hops and yeast bring out the Belgian characteristics.

In 2015, AHA Governing Committee member Drew Beechum gave us his two cents on what it means to him to ""transform a beer."" For him, it all starts with location, and he lets location inform his ingredients. He might say, ""Drew, what's your water source?"" or ""Drew, what grows in your area?"" just to get his brain and palate ticking on the most appropriate beer to brew. In this recipe, he takes your classic Bohemian Pilsner recipe and transforms it into his own version of the style. The modified directions can be found underneath the ingredients for the classic style.
This recipe was originally featured in the March/April 2015 issue of Zymurgy.","Ingredients:
Classic Bohemian Pilsner
11.0 lb. (4.99 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
2.25 oz. (63 g) Saaz, 4.5% a.a. (60 min.)
1.0 oz. (28 g) Saaz, 4.5% a.a. (0 min.)
Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager yeast
Transformer: Hobo Devil
Substitute a Belgian Pils malt like Castle for Bohemian and increase to 12 lb. (5.44 kg). An infusion mash schedule with a protein rest is sufficient for the highly modified base malt: 30-minute rests at 122°F (50°C) and 148°F (64°C), followed by a mash out at 168°F (75°C).
Add 0.5 lb. (227 g) aromatic malt.
Add 2 lb. (0.9 kg) table sugar to the boil.
Decrease bittering addition of Saaz to 2.0 oz. (57 g).
Substitute Wyeast 1388 Belgian Strong Ale yeast for Bohemian lager yeast.

Bill Schneller has been a homebrewer for 15 years and brews mostly Belgian style ales. He knows they are mysterious, and the recipes act more like guidelines for developing your own. In his article ""Belgian Style Ales: Tricks of the Trade"" found in January/February 2005 Zymurgy magazine, he gives a few tips and tricks to brew a quality Belgian farmhouse ale. But how did the farmhouse ale come to be?
The flatlands of Flanders were once the setting of many small, independent farms. Naturally, they brewed beer. Not just because it tasted great and was an important part of their culture, but because it was a necessary food product, providing crucial daily nutrition. The brewing season was short due to demands for harvesting crops, among other things, and so the cold winter months were spent brewing for the entire year. Since the brewing season was so short the ales needed to remain stable in flavor.
Farms developed two ways to create a brew to help keep it stable over the year - increase the hops or increase the alcohol content. The two methods resulted in distinct beer styles - one hoppy and refreshing, the other a full-bodied source of nutrition. These homemade ales were extremely varied in taste and quality because they were limited to the farms where they were brewed and consumed. Farmhouse ales are a true testament to homebrewing. Check out Bill's Farmhouse Ale below and see what you come up with!","Ingredients:

The golden-hued ale uses wheat, oats and barley for the grist, a dose of noble hops to add floral notes and honey and molasses for more fermentable sugars and a hint of subtle complexity. Unlike more well-known styles of German wheat beers, like hefeweizen, kottbusser is fermented with a clean ale yeast, leaving little to not yeast character in the finished beer.
Grimm Brothers Brewhouse of Loveland, Colorado shared the recipe for their kottbusser ale, Snowdrop. Snowdrop earned a bronze medal in the 2015 Great American Beer Festival.

Scott Jackson, member of Keg Ran Out Club (KROC) and Foam on the Range homebrew clubs in Colorado, shares his split-batch pumpkin ale recipes in the 2013 Sept/Oct Zymurgy, a recipe he’s been brewing for over 15 years and has a few medals to show for it.
Jackson says you don’t need to harvest fresh pumpkins to make pumpkin beer. Although baking fresh pumpkins works, you don’t get the same consistency as you do with a can of 100 percent pure pumpkin. Use the pumpkin in the mash, which although tricky, gives you a beautiful orange color and a little sugar from the starches in the pumpkin.
The protein rest reduces the gumminess of the pumpkin, and the rice hulls help with the sparge and wort collection. He also suggests using one clean high alpha hop addition at the beginning of the boil so you don’t disrupt the pumpkin and spice flavors.
Once your beers are finally ready, a fun, tasty way to serve the pumpkin ale is in a glass rimmed with brown sugar and to pair it with pumpkin-based desserts.","Ingredients:

To brew Duck Slippers Session Helles, a step infusion mash is employed. Add 8 quarts (7.6 L) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132°F (56°C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water or add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (22.71 L) of runoff. Add 60 minute hops and bring to a full vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperature of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35-45°F (1.5-7°C) for 3-6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Directions:
Heat 2 quarts (1.9 l) water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towle around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains or learn how to make spent grain flour. (LINK)
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 l). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.

You might prefer to use fruitier yeast, like Wyeast 1272 or Wyeast 1335. Substitute any other hops, but try to use the same quantity as this recipe.

While the origins of the steam beer name aren’t fully known, one explanation is it may have come from the steaming sound the beer made during the heated fermentation process, another is the warm conditioning caused the highly carbonated beer to spray when opened.
Anchor Brewing Company claims the name came from the steam emanating from the roof of breweries because there wasn’t any way to cool the hot wort during the brewing process. Brewers pumped the wort up to the roof and let the cool San Francisco air chill the wort, thus steam was often seen rising from rooftops across San Francisco.

Joe Nielsen of Berkley, Mich. earned a gold medal for his tripel, rising above 421 other Category 18: Belgian Strong Ale entries in the 2013 National Homebrew Competition.
Joe’s tripel uses three sugar adjunct additions: table sugar, honey and light brown sugar to increase the alcohol content, while creating that signature dry but full finish.

Directions:
Heat 4 quarts (4 L) of water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains.
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 3 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When three minutes remain add the three-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat.
Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let it sit for 15-30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of cold water has been added. If necessary add cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (21-liter) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.

Fix's opinion on Kölsch is that ""slightly bigger is better."" From his travels to Cologne, where the style originated, Fix thinks true, commercial examples of Kölsch are hoppier and maltier than described in the AHA style guidelines.

Barleywines are rooted in their strength, malt-forward sweetness and, in some cases, rampant hopping. But what if you want to push the limits of the style? What if you are seeking to brew an ""alternative barleywine?"" AHA Governing Committee member Drew Beechum set out with his club to answer that exact question, and one of the results was this recipe for Summer Time Wheat Wine.
This recipe consists of equal parts wheat and pale malt, with a touch vienna and honey. The mix of American and German noble hops make for a subdued hop profile, but a more aggressive ""west coast"" hop regimen can be used for a deliciously hoppy wheat wine.
But be careful if you plan to enjoy this beer at your next barbeque—the high alcohol content can go unnoticed among the smooth and slightly sweet ale. It's a sneaky one!

Spring has sprung, and it's time to start planning brews for the warmer months ahead.
In Belgium, particularly the French-speaking regions, saison was a style typically brewed on farms in the wintertime and enjoyed through the following spring and summer. Brewing gave farmhands something to do in the winter as well as a tempting beverage to motivate them through the day.
Mike Heniff, author of the following recipe, has spent a great deal of time quaffing his way through Belgium and exploring the styles and variations all over the country. His saison recipe keeps things simple, allowing for the yeast character and some hop bitterness to shine through. The result is a light-bodied ale perfect for quenching warm weather thirst, while still packing a bit of a punch. À votre santé!

418,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/peanut-butter-jelly-time/,Not Found,"According to the National Peanut Board, Americans eat enough peanut butter each year to make 10 billion peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. To celebrate National Peanut Butter Day (January 24), we're sharing this homebrew version of the classic PB&J.
This recipe comes from AHA governing Committee member Drew Beechum. Tired of ""the ubiquitous Peanut Butter Chocolate Porter/Stout"" rendition, Drew wanted to try a different way to incorporate peanut butter into his homebrew. He describes that the ""jelly"" character comes from a fruity yeast choice, and that the malt choices were made to emphasize the bread and toast characteristics in the beer.
Using peanut butter can be tricky, as the lipids found in a traditional jar of peanut butter are a classic killer of head in beer. In this recipe, Drew uses a powdered peanut butter called PB2, which has been dehydrated and had the oils extracted from the peanuts by the manufacturer.
If you can't seem to find powdered PB at the store, another way to do this is to decant the oil out in a jar of non-homogenized peanut butter at home. By letting the oil naturally separate out to the top of the jar, and then pouring it off the top every few days, you can decrease the oil and increase head retention in your beer.

Gluten sensitivity affects about 6 percent of the population, but that doesn’t mean they can’t share a homebrew with you! While the gluten protein is found in the most common brewing grains—barley, wheat and rye—brewers have a few different choices when it comes to brewing with gluten-free fermentables.
This recipe, which uses roasted chestnut chips, was featured in the May/June 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine, in an article about gluten-free brewing. Author Carolyn Smagalski commented that “Chestnuts have essentially the same nutritional content as malted barley except that the sugars are not as readily available. Amylase breaks down the starches and sugars to a fermentable level.” Expand your brewing horizons and give brewing with chestnuts a shot!","Ingredients:
5.0 lb (2.27 kg) roasted, dried chestnut chips
5.0 lb (2.27 kg) dextrose

Put about 5 gallons of room temperature water in a pot and add one tablespoon of amylase that has been dissolved in one cup of water per manufacturers directions. Place chips in a grain bag and steep in 5 gallons of water for at least 1-2 hours. During this time raise and lower the bag five to six times every hour or so to obtain maximum sugar extraction. During the the soaking and extraction process, the chips will absorb and retain about 3-4 quarts of water. At the end of the soak, you should end up with an amber-colored wort with a gravity of 1.016-1.020. Remove grain bag and drain thoroughly. Top off to 5 gallons (18.93L). Bring wort to a boil. Add Fuggles in a hop bag and continue to boil for another 30 minutes. Add dextrose and boil for 15 more minutes. At this time the gravity is usually 1.049-1.053. Remove from heat and steep Cascade in a hop bag for another 30 minutes. Remove hops and chill to pitching temp. Rack to fermenter, pitch,  and ferment at ambient temperatures, usually a little over three days. Once fermentation is complete, rack to secondary and add 1 ounce of 100 bloom type B clarifying gelatin as per manufacturers instructions. Mix thoroughly, clarify for three to four days. Bottle or keg as usual.","Note: for a darker brew, roast 1 to 1.5 lb (0.45 to 0.68 kg) of the chestnut chips at 350°F to desired color stirring every 10 minutes.

This recipe by Rick Debar of the Barrel House Brewing Company and Ray Snyder of the Bloatarian Brewing League is from the May/June 2008 issue of Zymurgy magazine. Bosmo’s Imperial Cream Ale was developed as a joint project between the homebrewers and the professional brewers of Greater Cincinnati. The name is in honor of the Bloatarian Brewing League’s iconic mascot, Bosmo; but the style is a tribute to the long history of excellent relationships between the homebrewing community and the professional brewers of the area.
Cream ale was chosen as the base style, because it was popularized in Cincinnati. Some people think ale brewers created cream ale to compete with the new lager beers in the latter part of the 19th century. Others believe the German brewmasters in America simply applied their experience with German ales to create cream ale. Either way we’re sure you will enjoy it!","Ingredients:

The following recipe appears in the March/April 2001 issue of Zymurgy magazine and is based off of a recipe originally published in The Complete Joy of Homebrewing by Charlie Papazian.
Here is what AHA founder Charlie Papazian had to say on this pumpkin beer recipe:
“Pumpkin Ale? Now, don’t discount this one so quickly. Pumpkins were used in colonial days as an essential ingredient in many brews. With a bit of tradition and modern art you can brew something that is as American as apple pie. Cucurbito Pepo (Pumpkin) Ale is not too assuming. With a medium body, adequate bitterness, amber color, alcoholic warmth and reassuring spices, this beer will be an incredible contribution to your repertoire of accomplishments.
“The spices that lend a typical pumpkin-pie character are not overdone, but they are optional if you choose to brew a simpler version. This is the kind of brew for which you invite friends over to help with the ceremonies of brewing. Surely a Thanksgiving or holiday season toast with Cucurbito Pepo Ale will be one of the most memorable. England, Belgium and Germany, eat your hearts out.”","Ingredients:
10 lb (4.54 kg) American 6-row pale lager malt
1 lb (0.45 kg) 20-40°L crystal/caramel malt
7-10 lb (3.2-4.5 kg) whole pumpkin
2 oz (56.8 g) Williamette hops (boiling): 10 HBU
0.5 oz (14.2 g) Cascade hops (boiling): 2.5 HBU

1 tsp (4 g) vanilla bean, chopped
0.5 tsp (2 g) freshly ground nutmeg
0.25 tsp (1 g) ground allspice
0.5 tsp (2 g) ground dried ginger

Boil Time: 75-90 minutes","Directions:
Chill some homebrew the day before so that it’s ready to enjoy on brew day. While the beer is chilling, slice the pumpkin in half and remove seeds and stringy “veins.” Roast the pumpkin in a 350°F (117°C) oven for about one hour or until soft. The roasted pulp will be used in the mash. Use a protein-developing step mash. Add 3 gallons (11.4 L) of 130°F (54.4°C) water to the crushed malt. Stabilize at 122°F (50°C) and hold for 30 minutes. Then add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of boiling water and thoroughly mashed pumpkin pulp. Add heat if necessary and stabilize at 148-152°F (64-67°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Add more heat and mash out to 165°F (74°C). Sparge with about 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Initial extract volume may be about 7-8 gallons (26.6-30.4 L). Anticipate a long, vigorous boil and evaporation of 2-3 gallons (7.6-11.4 L). Add boiling hops and boil for 75 to 90 minutes or until volume of boiling wort approaches 5.5 gallons (21 L). Then add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, vanilla and Irish moss and continue boiling 10 more minutes. Turn off heat. Add aroma hops and let steep for 2-3 minutes before straining hops and spices and chilling the wort. Pitch the yeast when cool. Bottle when fermentation is complete.","”
Darker Option
Adaptions to darken the beer made with this recipe were discussed in the March/April 2001 issue of Zymurgy.
Just adapt the recipe with roasted malts like Chocolate or Black malt, or perhaps use a porter recipe with pumpkin processing. You can always eliminate or lessen the spices used, which are traditionally found pumpkin pie.”"

Commercially brewed in France by Brasserie Grain d'Ogre (formerly Brasserie Jeanne d'Arc until 2002), Grain d'Ogre earned gold in Category 34*: French-style Bière de Garde at the 1996 World Beer Cup. Charlie scaled the recipe down for homebrewing purposes and provided this character description of the gold cup-winning ale:
""...Grain d'Ogre introduces itself in a corked bottle, virtually assuring a pleasant earthy, musty aroma. Appearance is crystal-clear and light amber in color. Well carbonated with a pleasant head. First aromatic impressions are a gentle, mild maltiness and musty cork character. Subdued ale aromatics contribute to an easy complexity without fruity esters. Full-bodied with a malty finish. The assault of malt and alcohol character on the palate highlights the beer's overall impact. Noble hop bitterness is soft and mild and generally balanced towards neutrality; hop flavor does not emerge. Pale malts with a hint of Munich and Caramamunich-type malts seem apparent, but the formulation is actually aromatic Vienna and French caramel malt"" (p. 240).

Part of the American ale style spectrum that proceeds from pale to amber to brown to porter, amber ales bridge pale and brown ales by adding body and sweetness and shifting the beer's balance away from the hops to the malt. Amber ales are sweeter than brown ales but will have more hop flavor and aroma dancing on top than a brown. Amber ales have become one of my favorite beers. I like the balance of these beers—they are very hearty and satisfying. This is my clone of Red Nectar Ale.","Ingredients:

Inspired by a long, rural tradition in Germany known as Kartoffelferien, or Potato Vacation, Hornst Dornbusch came up with this funky recipe to pay homage to the tuber that has long been of importance to Germany: the potato. Horst Dornbush, Brewers Publications author, presents this potato-beer recipe in the article ""Can You Say Kartoffelferienbier"" on page 41 of the January/February 2004 issue of Zymurgy magazine.
Named after a traditional, week-long break from school and work for potato harvesting in Germany, Potato Vacation Beer, or Kartoffelferienbier, is a funky ale that lives outside the realm of classic styles.
For a deeper look at this recipe and the use of potatoes in brewing, AHA members can head over to the eZymurgy online archive for instant access to this Zymurgy issue and many more!","Ingredients:
3.25 lb (1.5 kg) Pale two-row Pils or ale malt (2-4° L)
2.5 lb (1.13 kg) Munich malt (approx. 10° L)
6.5 lb (3 kg) Peeled raw potatoes at room temperature
1.33 oz (37 g) Bittering hops of 5% AA (Tettnanger, Fuggles, East Kent Goldings or Galena)
0.5 oz (14 g) Aroma hops (Tettnanger, Fuggles, East Kent Goldings or Willamette)

Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.048
Final Gravity: ~1.010 (will depend on yeast)
ABV: 5%
Boil Time: 60 minutes","Directions:
Using a blender or ricer, macerate the peeled, raw potatoes. Then make a quick, thick grain mash at temperature of about 156°F (69°C).
Use the least amount of water possible, but avoid lumps and dry spots. Then pour the potato mash into the grain bed and mix the grain and potatoes evenly for maximum exposure of both to all starches in the mash. Finally, top the grain/potato bed with about an inch of water at about 172°F (78°C).
All starch conversion should be completed within about 20 minutes from mixing the grain with the potato mush. At this point, you can start recirculating the wort for 15-20 minutes.
Sparge the wort into a brew kettle, and stop sparging when the kettle gravity is about 1.044. Allowing for 10% evaporation, this pre-boil gravity should get your brew up to the target OG of 1.048.
Add bittering hops 15 minutes into boil. Add aroma hops 10 minutes before the end of the boil.
Follow fermentation schedule above. Prime in bottles.","Primary: 5 days
Secondary: 14 days
Bottle Prime: 7-10 days
Extract-with-grains Option
Replace Pale two-row malt and Munich malt with 3 lbs (1.36 kg) plain light Pils or ale malt extract and 2.0 lbs (0.97 kg) Bavarian Munich malt extract. Because extract brewers need to convert potato starches without mashing (and there is no potato extract on the market), they need an additional 2 lbs (0.97 kg) Pale ale or Pils malt as grains for steeping with the potatoes.
Mix the pale malt with the macerated potatoes and about 2 gallons of colder water in a pot. Once the potatoes and grains are evenly mixed, heat the entire ""mess"" very slowly while stirring frequently to ensure an even heat distribution in the pot until the temperature has reached a target range of about 150-155°F (65 - 68°C). Then let the pot rest for another half hour, during which you want to maintain the temperature within the target range. Once complete, line a kitchen colander with cheesecloth, place the colander in a large bowl or your kettle, and pour or ladle the pot's content into the colander. Allow the mixture to drain thoroughly, which may take 15-20 minutes (shake vigorously every few minutes).
Mix the liquid you collected from the potato and grain ""mess"" with the 3 lbs of pale malt extract and the 2 lbs of Munich malt extract. Top off your kettle to your pre-boil volume and follow the boil/post-boil schedule as listed for the all-grain recipe."

Brewer’s Note:  “This Belgian style ale is intended to be a light bodied, tart and refreshing brew for a warm summer day.  It pours a hazy orange hue, with both sour and characteristic Brett aromas.  The flavor is reminiscent of sour cherries, currants, and Brett Funk, with some spicy yeast character, a moderate carbonation tingle and a dry finish.  Decant carefully as it is bottle conditioned and will contain some yeast sediment.”
Primary fermentation at 75° (24° C).

If you're a smoked beer fan, you will love this one! The cherry wood brings a lot of nice flavor profiles to this beer. It's balanced nicely by adding hops that are low in alpha acids (hop bitterness is not get along with the phenolic character of smoke) and honey malt to add sweetness. This beer was named after the late owner of Briess Malt & Ingredients Company, Roger Briess. This beer is a great reason to celebrate his enthusiasm. Enjoy!

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 11 quarts (10.5 L) of 140 °F (60 °C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132 °F (53 °C) for 30 minutes. Add 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167 °F (75 °C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 20 mintues remain, add the German Hallertauer hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add both the French Strisselspalt and Mt. Hood hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55 °F (12.5 °C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35-45 °F (1.5-7 °C) for 3-6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

Pitch with dregs from old 1996 batch of homebrewed Lambic-style ale, and Wyeast 1968. Insert an oak stave that has been in other batches of lambic. The 1996 batch was brewed with the dregs from commercial lambics and Yeast Labs Pediococcus and brettanomyces lambicus. After 16 months add three cans raspberry puree and Wyeast 3526. Twenty-two months after brewing, add last can of raspberry puree.
Primary fermentation: 3 years in plastic
Bottle conditioning time: 1 year","Judges' Comments
High acetic sourness. Some fruit sweetness to balance. Strong sourness lasts through finish. Like a well-aged vinegar. Could use some more complexity like Brett in flavor. Some wheat. Raspberry not present. Could use more fruit flavor/aroma to balance sourness. Additional carbonation would improve presentation. Intense sourness with bit of raspberry in aftertaste, could use Brett to balance out the sourness and provide the refreshingly dry finish that's needed. Some oak might help."

Janet's Brown Ale is no stranger to the world of homebrewing recipes. Mike McDole took home a medal when this recipe won gold in Category 10: Brown Ale at the American Homebrewers Assocation (AHA) National Homebrew Competition (NHC) in 2004. The award winning recipe was then featured in Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer's book, Brewing Classic Styles, as an example of a bigger, hoppier American Brown Ale. In 2009, McDole took gold again at the AHA NHC with an updated recipe that he categoraized as Imperial Brown Ale, but this time in Category 23: Speciality Beers. Though Janet's Brown Ale deviates a bit from the style guidelines for a traditional American Brown Ale, surely you will not be upset by the higher IBUs and ABV after taking a sip!","Ingredients:

Sulfite according to pH of must (dosage chart at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/frameset.htm). Add CaCl2 and PME (not the same thing as pectic/pectolytic enzyme) 24 hours after sulfitization to help induce brown cap. PME may be added earlier during maceration to boost pectin load for keeving but CaCl2 is still added later. CaCl2 dosage assumes heavy pectin load; use less as needed. First racking was done on Day 36 when fully clear but not yet fermenting. No wild yeast fermentation within five weeks as desired so added 20 ml of actively fermenting cider containing Premiér Cuvée yeast as a seed culture. Observable fermentation began 10 days later. Yeast was grown in the cider to tie up critical soluble nitrogen-rich nutrients and remove them later at racking. Re-racked when the fermentation curve approached bottom (average 0.16 degree Brix drop per day over nine days and slowing). Bottled without preservatives.
Acidity of Must is pH 3.5 with Total Acidity 5.8 g/L (expressed as tartaric).

Start with 5 gallons of cider and freeze the remaining gallon. Unless you are starting with a pasteurized cider add sugars, yeast nutrient and Camden tablets or sodium metabisulfite 24 hours before you plan to pitch your yeast.
Rehydrate yeast according to directions on packet. You may wish to do a starter yeast culture, but I have found that it’s not always necessary for small (5 gallon) batches. While waiting for the yeast to rehydrate, vigorously shake or stir the must to ensure proper aeration and that the sugars and yeast nutrient have dissolved. Pitch your yeast and close primary fermenter with an air lock that is fairly resistant to plugging. After primary fermentation stops, defrost your frozen gallon of cider, or acquire a fresh gallon of pasteurized cider and add it along with your cinnamon sticks and cloves to the carboy that you will be racking your cider into. You should see a secondary fermentation kick off, so be sure not to bottle until the secondary fermentation has ended and your cider has clarified.",

Jose Gomera of East Patchogue, New York, a member of the Long Island Beer and Malt Enthusiasts and Brewers East End Revival, won a bronze medal in Category 27: Fruit Beer during the 2023 National Homebrew Competition Final Round in San Diego. Gomera, along with co-brewer and sister Albania Morales, brewed a blonde ale with guava that was chosen third out of 144 entries in the category.
Gomera and Morales were trying to fine-tune the hops on what they considered to be a solid blonde ale recipe, and they decided to try for a fruit beer since it was springtime. The result is a creamy fruit beer with a blonde ale base that has just enough hop and guava character to keep it interesting and, most importantly, refreshing. As with prior versions of this blonde ale, Gomera and Morales named the recipe after a Blondie song.","Ingredients:

This is a really fun and easy kettle sour recipe. We have made it with different fruits (and some vegetables) but like the raspberry the best. When not brewing for NHC, we will generally split this 8-gallon recipe into two batches and add different fruits to each. We brew on a Spike Solo, so this is a brew-in-a-bag recipe. Start with RO water and build profile. Mash in at 149°F (65°C) and hold for 45 min. Raise temperature to 154°F (68°C) and hold for 15 min. Mash out at 168°F (76°C) for 15 min. Target a mash pH of 5.2. Boil for 10 min. Chill to 95°F (35°C). Use lactic acid to pre-acidify your wort to pH of 4.4–4.5. Pitch the Lactobacillus. Purge the kettle headspace with CO2. (We have a kettle lid with a camlock fitting on top, and we run a line from our CO2 tank to the kettle and connect to the camlock. We tightly wrap the junction of the kettle and kettle lid with cellophane to attempt to seal the vessel. We purge frequently with CO2 as the beer is souring.) Hold kettle at 95°F (35°C) for 24–48 hours for souring. Target a pH of 3.2–3.5 depending on desired sourness. Once wort has soured, heat kettle and boil for 15 min. Add hops at 10 min. Add whirlpool hops and salt and hold for 15 min. at 185°F (85°C). Chill to 95°F. Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 95°F. As fermentation activity is slowing (usually within 24–30 hours), add the berries. We put the berries in mesh brew bags and drop into the fermenter. Hold for 2 weeks. Transfer beer to secondary.

Bulk treat 10 gal. (37.85 L) RO water with 2 g each pickling lime, gypsum, and calcium chloride.
Follow low-oxygen brewing practices to the extent possible with your system. Techniques employed were pre-boiling and chilling strike water, purging tubing and grain bed with CO2, underletting mash, using a mash cap, and conducting a full-volume mash to avoid need for sparging.
Dough in at 144°F (62°C), then step mash at 148°F (64°C), 153°F (67°C), 163°F (73°C), and 170°F (77°C) for 45, 10, 45, and 15 min., respectively.
Boil gently with kettle partially covered for 60 min. Adjust pH to 5.1 with 15 min. remaining in boil. Add Whirlfloc with 5 min. left in boil.
Chill rapidly and transfer clear wort to fermenter, minimizing carryover of trub and hop matter as much as possible. Oxygenate to 16–18 ppm. Pitch yeast at 62°F (17°C) and allow to free-rise to 66°F (19°C) at about 60% of expected attenuation.
Closed-transfer to CO2-purged keg with 3-4 remaining gravity points and spund to 2.8 vol. (5.6 g/L) CO2. Lager until clear.",

This is a full-boil extract-based beer. Preheat oven to 165°F (74°C). Crush grain malts and place in a grain bag. Heat 0.7 gal. (2.6 L) of Publix spring water to 150°F (66°C) in a gallon-sized pot. Add grain bag to hot water in the pot, then place the pot in the oven and allow grains to steep for 25 min. at 150°F (66°C). Meanwhile, heat 4 gal. (15.14 L) Publix spring water and 2 gal. (7.57 L) Publix distilled water to 150°F (66°C) in a brew kettle large enough to hold the full boil volume. After the steep, place a plastic colander over the brew kettle, remove the bag of steeping grains from the smaller pot, and place the grain bag in the colander. Pour the steeping liquid through the grain bag and into the brew kettle. Add the malt extract and maltodextrin and bring to a boil. After hot break collapses, add hops and boil for 60 min. Cool wort quickly and transfer to fermenter. Add additional Publix spring water if needed to obtain about 5.25 gal. (19.9 L) wort. Aerate wort and pitch yeast when wort temperature is 64°F (18°C). Ferment for three days at 64°F (18°C) and then allow temperature to gently rise to 68–70°F (20–21°C) until fermentation is complete, about 4 days. Check beer with hydrometer to ensure fermentation is complete (readings should be the same on three consecutive days). Bottle with 5.2 oz. (147 g) priming sugar and allow filled bottles to carbonate at room temperature for at least three days. I prefer to allow beer to age for an additional week or two before drinking.",

* * *
I’ve always had challenges with the name “bitter.” Bitter is not a very romantic name for a style. One would never name a wine style “acidic.” Yes, the style name “bitter” pre-dates sensory terminology by several hundred years, but like any homebrewer, I have the power to change things I brew, so I will henceforth encourage the world to refer to ESB as Extra Special Beautiful.
Now on to my quest to perfect this style. I’m personally favoring Strong Bitter (11C in Beer Judge Certification Program 2021 Guidelines) over Ordinary and Best Bitter. It has more girth, mouthfeel, and residual sugar, yet is still very sessionable, with an ABV range of 4.6 to 6.2%.

Peter shares the following of his award-winning recipe:
Inspired by a visit to a new, local craft brewery called Oakflower in Millington, New Jersey, this beer started life as an experiment to see what a 100% Citra-hopped hazy IPA would be like. Two iterations later it medaled in the National Homebrew Competition!
The key parts about brewing this beer are:
Boil the mash water and then cool before mashing.
Start the first dry hop no sooner than day 7
Lower the hopping temperature for both the first and second dry hop.
It goes without saying that oxygen is not your friend when it comes to heavily hopped beers, so closed transfer is essential when kegging. One final piece that I have recently found to be successful: dissolve 5 grams of Ascorbic Acid in 50 milliliters of distilled water and inject it through the gas quick disconnect prior to carbonating and conditioning.","Ingredients:

This is a great recipe that I’ve come back to a couple times and brewed in multiple ways. Anytime you need a good drinking beer, this is a go-to, and it is usually affordable. It’s modeled after one of Ghostfish Brewing Co.’s most-awarded flagships, Grapefuit IPA.
Zero Tolerance members demonstrated this beer for a seminar and club night at Homebrew Con. I wanted a recipe that people would find difficult to distinguish between all-grain and extract, but would still be easier to source than other gluten-free recipes.
The toughest part is getting around the flavors that sorghum produces. Many claim to taste a metallic or chlorophenolic “twang” when they try sorghum beers. That is why we rely on grapefruit-tasting Yakima Valley Hops Experimental Grapefruit hops and, optionally, grapefruit peel. By leaning into the flavor distance, we’re making something undesirable desirable.
I suggest using yeast nutrient since dry yeast sometimes has trouble finishing sorghum. It’ll help achieve full attenuation when you do start using grain.
This recipe tastes great with the zest of one grapefruit in secondary. Just soak the zest in vodka while primary fermentation takes place and add the entire tincture to secondary along with the dry hops.","Ingredients:

Mash at 152° F (67° C) for 60 min with 12.8 qt. strike water. Batch sparge with 7.42 gal. (28 L) of water at 168° F (76° C). Collect first gallon of runnings in a separate boiling pot. While collecting the remaining wort in the brew kettle, bring the 1 gal. of first runnings to a boil. Boil this gallon of wort until it is reduced by half, taking care not to burn the wort. This will allow for a nice caramelization. Add this 1/2 gal. of wort to the main brew kettle and boil for 60 min. After 60 min. boil, cool wort to 55° F (13° C) or as low as your chiller will go. Pitch yeast starter into cooled wort and ferment at 55° F (13° C) for 3 weeks. Once gravity has reached 1.010 (2.5° P), transfer beer to secondary or keg. Lager beer in secondary or keg at 33° F (1° C) for 30 days before serving. Style calls for low to medium level of carbonation.",

Age hops in open bags for over a year, or until they smell more of hay than cheese. Unmalted grains and boiled oats make the total efficiency lower than calculated.

Although a neutral/wine barrel is preferred, I obtained this 15 gal. barrel from a friend in the club who had been aging excellent sour beer in it. Initially, he had opened the barrel and stripped it of char. It also had a hefty Brett culture thriving in it when I filled it. I have waxed around 2/3 of the staves and one head. After each Solera turn, I top off the headspace with a starter of whatever Brett culture I can buy at my LHBS at that time. Periodically I also add dregs of good beers that are in the same vein as this golden sour ale and conditioned without wine yeast. After kegging, keep at room temp until tetrahydropyridine (THP), if any, is aged out of the beer. Force carbonate medium-high/high.",

Target a relatively high mash temperature so that the beer finishes near 4°P (1.016). I recommend 155–160°F (68.3–71.1°C). Add the gruit blend 5 minutes before flameout, or steep after flameout for 15 minutes, agitating every 3–5 minutes (I prefer the results of flameout steeping.) Filter the beer through wheat straw post-fermentation. This beer would have been consumed still, but it is very tasty and stable as a carbonated beverage.

Wyeast 3068 Wehinstephan Weizen or White Labs WLP300 Hefeweizen Ale yeast (1.2 qt. or 1.1 L starter)

SRM: 3.9","Directions:
Make your yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. In the kettle, heat 4.1 gallons (16 L) of water to 113° F (45° C) and mash in with grain to stabilize at 104° F (40° C). Mix grain into the water and stir the mash quietly to minimize the amount of oxygen entrained in the mash. Immediately start heating the mash to 122° F (50° C). Stir continuously but gently as the mash heats. The temperature should rise by approximately 2° F (1° C) per minute. When the mash reaches 113° F (45° C), pause for 5 minutes, and then resume heating to 122° F (50° C). Rest here for 15 minutes, and then pull a decoction equal to about 40 percent of the mash volume. Choose the thickest part of the mash. Transfer this to a large pot and begin heating, gently. Stir gently and continuously as you heat. You may need to add water if the decoction gets so thick that scorching is possible. When the decoction reaches 158° F (70° C), rest until an iodine test comes back negative, and then continue heating. Boil the decoction for 20 minutes, stirring (gently) nearly constantly. You may occasionally need to heat the main mash to hold its temperature at 122° F (50° C). Return the decoction to the main mash with as little splashing as possible. Stir and adjust temperature, if needed, to 149° F (65° C). Hold at 149° F (65° C) for 15 minutes, then heat mash—stirring (quietly) almost constantly—to 158° F (70° C). Rest at 158° F (70° C) until a negative iodine test is returned, then begin heating the mash to 168° F (76° C). Quietly transfer the mash to the lauter tun. Recirculate for about 20 minutes, then begin running off wort. Sparge with water hot enough to hold the grain bed temperature at 168° F (76° C). You will need about 3.7 gallons (14 L) of sparge water for this. Collect 6.3 gallons (24 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops for the final 60 minutes. Cool the wort to 54° F (12° C). Transfer 3.6 qt. (3.4 L) of this (chilled, not aerated, not pitched) wort to sanitized Mason jars. Store jars in a refrigerator until needed (as speise). Transfer the remaining wort—4.4 gallons (17 L)—to a sanitized bucket fermenter, aerate the wort, and pitch the sediment from the yeast starter. Ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). Take the lid off the bucket for the 1 to 2 days when the fermentation is at it’s most vigorous. Reseal the bucket and affix the airlock, and resume a closed fermentation, after this period. (If you’d like, you could crop some yeast from the fermentation before sealing the bucket.) After fermentation stops, allow the beer to settle for 4–10 days. Prime the beer with speise, add lager yeast, and bottle in heavy bottles. Store the beer warm for 2 weeks to bottle condition to 4.0 volumes of CO2.",

A straightforward, single-infusion-mash wheat beer made from 50 percent wheat malt. The procedures aren’t traditional, but nobody will know that unless you tell them.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4.5 lb. (2 kg) Pilsner malt
4.5 lb. (2 kg) red wheat malt
HOPS
1.2 oz. (34 g) Hallertau, 4% a.a. @ 60 min
YEAST
Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan Weizen or White Labs WLP300 Hefeweizen Ale yeast (1.3 qt. or 1.2 L starter)
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
9.5 oz. (270 g) corn sugar for priming

Yield: 5 gallons (18.9 L)
Original Gravity: 1.048
Final Gravity: 1.01
ABV: 4.90%
IBU: 18
SRM: 3.5","Directions:
Make your yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. Heat 3 gallons (11 L) of water to the proper strike temperature to mash in at 149° F (65° C). If your malt and equipment is at room temperature, the strike water temperature should be around 160° F (71° C). Mash at 149° F (65° C) for 60–75 minutes. Mash out at 168° F (76° C) and recirculate. Collect 5.9 gallons (22 L) of wort. You’ll need about 3.5 gallons (13 L) of sparge water for this. The sparge water should be heated enough that the grain bed remains around 168° F (76° C). Boil the wort for 60–75 minutes. (You may need to add boiling water to keep the volume from dipping below 5 gallons/19 L.) Add hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort to 54° F (12° C). Aerate and pitch yeast from yeast starter. Let ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). After fermentation stops, allow the beer to sit for 3–7 days.

This is a very straightforward extract recipe with 50 percent wheat malt. A small partial mash lends the aroma of wheat and Pilsner malts.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4 lb. (1.8 kg) liquid wheat malt extract
1.5 lb. (680 g) Pilsner malt
1.5 lb. (680 g) red wheat malt
HOPS
1.25 oz. (35 g) Hallertau, 4% a.a. @ 60 min

11 g sachet Danstar Munich Wheat Beer dried yeast (no starter required)

SRM: 3.6","Directions:
In a large kitchen pot (not your brew kettle), heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to 161° F (72° C). Place crushed malts in a nylon steeping bag and steep them in the hot water for 45 minutes. Hold temperature as close to 150° F (66° C) as you can reasonably manage over this period. (This is a small mash.) Stir occasionally. Additionally, heat 0.5 gallons (2 L) of water to 170° F (77° C) in a small pot and heat 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water to a boil in your brew pot. When the mash is over, place a colander over your brew kettle and place the grain bag in it. Pour the wort from the small mash through the grains (to filter out any large bits of grain) and rinse with the 170° F (77° C) water. Set grain bag aside. Dissolve roughly half the malt extract in the brew pot and resume boiling. To dissolve the malt extract, put it into one of the pots you used previously. Ladle hot wort from the brewpot onto it and stir to “pre-dissolve” it a bit. Then, stir it into the brewpot liquid. This will help ensure that none of the heavy extract sinks to the bottom of the pot and scorches. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Do not let boil volume dip below 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) during boil. Top up with boiling water, if needed, to avoid this. Stir in the remaining malt extract during the final 10 minutes of the boil. When the boil is finished, cool the wort to 54° F (12° C), or as cool as you can get it with a reasonable effort. Transfer to a sanitized fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment, allowing the temperature to creep up to 64° F (18° C). Prime beer with corn sugar in bottling bucket. If using standard beer bottles, prime for 3 volumes of CO2 using 6.5 oz. (180 g) of corn sugar. If you are using heavy wheat beer bottles, prime for 4.0 volumes of CO2 using 9.5 oz. (270 g) of corn sugar. Store bottles somewhere warm for two weeks. Check for carbonation and move beer to cold storage.",

In an article in 2005,  Bill Schneller wrote about the tricks of the trade when it comes to brewing Belgian-style beers. Schneller mentions that Belgian styles are a great place to experiment with adjuncts like corn, wheat, or rye. Corn, that all-American adjunct, is great in Belgian-style ales because it keeps its color and body light. The combination between the flaked corn and the sugar creates a lighter beer and accentuates the yeast aromas.

Directions and tasting notes for Wynkoop Colorojo Clone courtesy of Andy Brown. We boil our Denver city water before the brew day and acidulate it with gypsum or acidulated malt. The single infusion mash temperature for this beer is at 154°F (67.5°C) for 50 minutes. We sparge with 170°F (77°C) water for mash out and get a pre-boil gravity of about 1.068 or 17 Plato. The first hop addition is 10 minutes after a good rolling boil is established. After the boil, we steep the zero minute hop addition for about 15 minutes and knockout the hot wort through the whole leaf hops in a pressurizable hop back that I made from an old filter housing. You could use your mash tun as a hop back if you don’t have a hop back. We ferment at 69°F (21°C) and then after 10 days rack the beer to a conditioning tank, adding the whole leaf dry hops in weighted infusion bags. After eight days of dry hopping, we rack the beer to a serving vessel, add finings, carbonate and serve after 72 hours.","Tasting Notes
""I really like the American imperial red ales that have the maltiness to back all the hops we add. Colorojo has a deep reddish brown color and some haze because it is unfilitered. The IBUs are not out of hand and I like being able to keep the three hop varieties distinct in the flavor and aroma of the beer. El Dorado is a new hop variety with interesting tropical fruit and juicy candy flavors, but Amarillo really steals the show as the signature hop for this beer with its tangerine flavor. Drinking this beer is like biting into a really bitter blood orange. I know some of these hop varieties are hard to come by the Wynkoop I will be happy to get you some of ours for your clone homebrew. Just save me a bottle!"" - Andy Brown

Mash grains at 158° F (70° C) for one hour. Mash out at 168° F (76° C) for five minutes. After primary fermentation, transfer to glass secondary and pitch Wyeast Roselare Blend as well as ~250 mL (~1 cup) of previous year’s batch (before packaging) and age at ~70°F (21° C) with a silicon airlock until desired character/acidity is reached (in this case ~ 9 months). During the course of fermentation, dregs of several sour beers were added to fermentation including Gueuze Girardin and a homebrewed Sour Blonde Ale (~12 separate batches that were brewed by different homebrewers and blended) that was aged in an oak barrel that previously contained New Belgium La Folie. Soak 2 oz (57 g) of medium toast French oak cubes in Daron Calvados (enough to completely cover oak cubes) for a couple weeks. Add oak cube/Calvados mixture to beer and age an additional 3 months or until desired character is achieved. Transfer beer to keg and force carbonate to ~2.5 volumes of CO2. After a while of enjoyment on tap, bottle using counter pressure bottle filler. Age bottles at cellar temperature (in this case ~8 months); pellicle will form in the bottle and character will develop for many years.

Final Gravity: 1.021
ABV: 8.40%
SRM: 7","Directions:
Mash at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Do not oversparge—a smaller pre-boil volume than normal is fine given the small grain bill. Boil for 60 minutes. Add DME at end of boil. Top up with cold water if necessary to reach target volume/gravity. Ferment two weeks at 68° F (20° C) in primary, then transfer to secondary and condition for three weeks at 68° F (20° C). Bottle prime with 5 oz + 2.5 tsp of dextrose for 2.75 volumes of CO2. Rest bottles in cellar for at least 2 months.
Brewer’s Note: I used homegrown hops with unknown AA% (lower than commercial Centennial hops). Because of the smaller boil volume and the fact that a strong boil is not needed for the style nor to boil off liquid, this recipe is ideal for a 5 gallon pot on a stovetop. I have not tried an extract-only version, but it seems that 8 lbs of Wheat DME and 1.5 lbs table sugar would do it. Boil maybe 3 lbs of the Wheat DME and the 1.5 lbs sugar for 60 minutes, then add the rest of the DME at the end of the boil.

No-sparge method with 10 gal. of reverse osmosis water (3.48 qt./lb.). Mash in with initial temperature of 151° F (66° C). Rest for 4 hours, during which time the mash temperature may drop as low as 142° F (61° C). Raise temperature to 156° F (69° C) by applying direct heat and recirculating. Run off to kettle and boil for 90 minutes. Chill to 46° F (8° C) and pitch yeast with 90 seconds of pure O2. Monitor temperature using thermowell in carboy. Ferment at 48° F (9° C) until gravity reaches 1.020 (approximately 5 days). Let rise to 52° F (11° F) until gravity reaches 1.012 SG (approximately 2 days). Let rise to 62° F (17° C) until completion (approximately 3 days). Closed transfer to fully CO2 purged and sanitized keg. Chill to 32° F (0° C) and lager for 2 weeks. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes (5 g/L) of CO2. The very long mash time is a function of convenience, but creates a very fermentable wort. Use gelatin fining if required to clear after lagering.

732,https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/recipe-of-the-weekpropensity-pilsener-lager/,Not Found,"This recipe is featured in AHA founder Charlie Papazian's book The Complete Joy of Homebrewing.
From Charlie Papazian: ""Although the honey may seem unusual for this traditional style of beer, it adds a character reminiscent of Authentic Czech pilsener. It is one malt-extract beer that has come close to the lusciousness of the twentieth-century brewed Pilsner Urquell or the original full-flavored and wonderful malt- and hop-graced Czech Budweiser. The use of light honey in this recipe helps introduce the character of a light-bodied pilsener while celebrating the roundness of malt and the crispness of hops. Simply brewed, Propensity Czech Pilsener is a treat for the connoisseur of true, traditional, and original Czech-style lagers.""","Ingredients:
5 lb (2.27 kg) Plain light dried malt extract
1 lb (0.45 kg) Crystal malt
2.5 lb (1.13 kg) light clover honey
2.5 oz (71 g) Saaz hops (boiling)
0.5 oz (14 g) Tettnanger hops (flavor)
0.5 oz (14 g) Saaz hops (finishing)
1-2 pkgs lager yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar or 0.25 cup dried malt extract for (bottling)
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.048-1.052 (12-13 °P)
Final Gravity: 1.007-1.010 (2-2.5 °P)
ABV: ~5.5%","Directions:
Add the cracked crystal malt to 1.5 gallons of cold water and bring to a boil.
When boiling has commenced remove the grains with a strainer.
Add the malt extract, honey and boiling hops and boil for 45 minutes.
Add the Tettnanger hops 10 minutes before the end of the boil.
Add the Saaz during the final 1-2 minutes of the boil. Sparge immediately and add the hot wort to the fermentor and cold water.
Add yeast when cool and bottle when fermentation is complete.
Propensity Pilsener can be matured for 3-4 weeks in the bottle at room temperatures and longer at cool temperatures. Drink and appreciate when you are ready!

After racking an English dark mild to a keg, we decided to put some old orange blossom honey and the must and oak chips from an even older wine kit on top of the mild’s yeast cake. Fermentation was sluggish, so K1-V1116 was directly pitched on day 2 of primary fermentation. Fermentation stopped at 1.087, so we made a starter of EC-1118 yeast with a little honey and pitched it at high kräusen. The mead only dropped to 1.084 and was sticky sweet, like grape jelly. We balanced the sweetness with citric acid and wine tannin and added the peanut butter whiskey to give it a PB&J flavor. It was still sweet, so we carbonated it to 1.5 vol. (3 g/L) CO2 in a 2-liter bottle with a carbonation cap just prior to bottling for competition, and something really changed. There are many ways to achieve balance in a mead, and we are glad we finally figured this one out!",

Clean and sanitize all equipment before making mead. Mix 5.1 lb. (2.31 kg) honey, 6 qt. (5.68 L) pear juice, and enough spring water to reach 5 gal. Add pectic enzyme and nutrients. Because kveik yeast works so quickly at high temperatures (this mead finished in less than a week), treat the must as high YAN (yeast-assimilable nitrogen) and add all nutrients (i.e., do not stagger) before pitching yeast. Oxygenate (or stir vigorously) for about a minute prior to pitch. No starter was used, just pitch the pouch. This mead was fermented in a bucket wrapped in a honey warming blanket. The blanket maintains a fairly consistent temperature of around 100°F (38°C). If you don’t have a blanket, we have also made this mead by fermenting in our garage in the July/August Midwest heat. The temperature is not as consistent due to ebbs and flows from day to night, but it was still warm enough to do the job. Stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate before back-sweetening. The honey for back-sweetening was about 3 lb. (1.36 kg), adjusted to around 1.025 (6.25 Bx), but this is personal preference. Use tartaric acid to adjust acidity of final mead, again to preference. Clear with SuperKleer KC. This mead is pétillant and was carbonated in a keg. Cheers!",

I did this as two separate honey fermentations (clover and eucalyptus) that I blended together, but you could do them together if that’s easier. For a 5-gallon batch, use 9 pounds each and dilute with water to hit an OG of 1.125, assuming that you’ll get about 100 gravity points of attenuation from the yeast. You can always back-sweeten to whatever level of sweetness you prefer, I like this to be semi-sweet and 1.015–1.020 final gravity. Rehydrate 10 g (2 packs) of Lalvin 71B in 250 mL warm water with 12.5 g GoFerm. Use staggered nutrient additions of 7 g Fermaid O at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days. Primary will take 21–30 days, then rack and clarify (I like Sparkolloid). I used a 5-gallon used whiskey barrel seasoned with 750 mL locally sourced gin, but you could also use oak cubes, spirals or chips.

I probably made this more complicated than I needed to. It started as a test. In a previous life, I was the director of import sales for Pacific Resources Inc,, the largest importer of Manuka honey from New Zealand. I wondered what Manuka would taste like in a cyser, so they gave me some to test with. Because I wasn’t sure how strong the flavors would be, I started by making four 1-gallon batches by diluting Manuka honey into apple juice; 1.3 lb., 2.6 lb., 3.9 lb., and 5.2 lb., topping off each jug with apple juice. Obviously the OGs were crazy high for the last two, but I went with it: 1.076 (18.5 Bx), 1.110 (26 Bx), 1.170 (38.25 Bx), 1.200 (43.9 Bx). I added the QA23 to each and let them ferment separately for four months yielding the following FGs: 1.000 (0 Bx), 1.004 (1 Bx), 1.054 (13.25 Bx), 1.134 (31 Bx). Upon tasting, the batches were on a continuum of astringent/bitter to very sweet, as they were still high in sugars. I played with different combinations of mixing the four, and finally settled on just racking all four of them to a 6-gallon (22.71-L) carboy along with 2 gal. (7.57 L) of unfermented apple juice and some Campden tabs. Then I popped it into the fridge for a cold crash. Once everything settled, I added some potassium sorbate and racked to a sanitized keg, where I forced carbonated it. Finally, after it was fully carbonated (a little over carbonated to compensate for bottling), I used the Last Straw to bottle the cyser for sharing!",

Fermentables
7 lb (3.15 kg) Linden/Basswood or Heather honey
4.3 G (16.3 L) low carbonate/sulfate chlorine/chloramine free water
20 oz. (570 grams) of thin juniper branches preferably with berries (30 grams/L)
6.25 grams GoFerm Protect (with 125ml water)
16.4 grams Fermaid O (FAN source) (with 290ml water)
5 grams Meadowsweet (dried)
500 grams Linden/Basswood or Heather honey for backsweetening to 1.020 finishing gravity
2.8 grams Potassium MetaBiSulfite
7.5 grams Potassium Sorbate
Yeast
5 grams Kveik VOSS (dried)
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gal
Original Gravity: 1.05
Final Gravity: 1.001
ABV: 6%
SRM: 1.5","Directions:
Heat water to 180F (82C). Allow to cool to 160F (71C) and immediately pour over the juniper branches. Infuse for a minimum of 1 hour (cover to retain heat, and/or wrap with a blanket), this step is often left to sit overnight.
When the juniper infusion is ready, taste it! If it does not have detectable pine/resin/spice you should stop and find another source for juniper branches. Alternate: Spruce or Fir tips, light green spring growth only, use 1oz per gallon – taste before using. Spruce and Fir tips can have a powerful impact!
Measure the GoFerm into a flask or beaker. Add 4 oz. (125 ml.) of 150F (65C) water and mix thoroughly. Allow the GoFerm to cool to 95F (35C).
While the GoFerm is reaching temperature, remove the juniper and incorporate the honey into the juniper infusion and mix thoroughly.
When the GoFerm has reached temperature, add the yeast. Mix thoroughly and allow it to “bloom” for no more than 10 minutes. Check the temperature of the must and the yeast. If they are within a range of 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees C) pitch the yeast into the must and mix thoroughly. Oxygenate the must to 10ppm (if this is not possible for you, whip air into the must for several minutes to reach approximately 6ppm O2).
If they are not within range, add 4 oz. (125 ml.) of must to the yeast to “atemperate” the mixture. Repeat this process every 10 minutes until the yeast is within the aforementioned range.
While the yeast is acclimating to the must, mix the Fermaid O into 10 oz. (290 ml) of 150F (65C) water. Allow the Fermaid O to cool to 100F (37C) and incorporate into the must. This is called “front loading”, and is a departure from the typically recommended 4 staggered nutrient additions.
Close up the fermentation container, put a blowoff tube in place or alternatively, an airlock.
Note: This will be a vigorous fermentation, you should ensure there is a minimum volume of 2G (7.6L) of headspace in the fermenter. Ferment at 104F (40C).
Ferment to terminal gravity (1.000 or less). It’s likely this will be reached within 24 hours, but let it ferment until it reaches terminal gravity.
Chill the fermenter to drop some of the yeast. Rack off of the lees to a new vessel. Stabilize the mead with Potassium MetaBiSulfite and Potassium Sorbate. Mix gently, and wait 4 hours for the SO2 sources to integrate.
Warm the backsweetening honey to 95F (35C), pull approximately 8 ounces (250ml) of the mead from the fermenter and incorporate into the honey until thoroughly mixed.
Add the Meadowsweet in a “hop bag” to the mead, and decant the backsweetening volume into the fermenter. Gently mix until well incorporated and let it sit for 1-2 days. Taste one to two times per day to assess the impact of the Meadowsweet addition. Pull the Meadowsweet as soon as it’s at the intensity you desire.
Rack the mead to a new vessel for fining. If you don’t want to fine you can enjoy as is, or wait until it’s clear. If you wait, you should have as little headspace as possible to avoid oxidation of the mead.
Enjoy!",

This mead is named after one of my favorite overheard comments when I was entering more often than I do now. Fermented upper 60s Fahrenheit. Not quite a Dwojniak (1:1 honey to water), but more like 2:3. Gravity is high enough that it is still wise to slowly introduce the yeast to the must over a day or two, and to step feed the last bit of your honey. Caramelized honey was done in a slow cooker, and I’m not very experienced at it. Most bochet I’ve had tasted burnt; I just wanted a light but noticeable warm, inviting caramelized character. Keep tasting, and remember it tastes darker than it looks as it is caramelizing, and be careful not to burn yourself. Don’t be in a hurry—this was a long-term project that took a few years before I was happy. I ended up doing a whole series of “cognac barrel” stuff. I didn’t source a used cognac barrel, although though that would be cool. I just use small (usually 10 L) new barrels, usually medium toast. First a cider would basically go in overnight to rinse some of the raw flavors out and giving me super oaky cider that I can use in small amounts for years in cider blends. Then I literally added a cognac I liked and rolled it around for weeks. No, you should not break out the XXO, but don’t cheap out either. Go for the most intense flavor for your buck–this is not the time for subtlety. After rolling around in the barrel, the cognac was dumped and a traditional mead was aged, then a pear mead, then this mead, and finally it was soaked in maple syrup and a spiced cyser went in. In each case, the barrel mead was intentionally a bit barrel-intense, as it was then blended back into the portion without the barrel. Perhaps I’ll eventually share the others if you ask nicely.",

Staggered nutrient additions. Fermented low 60s °F. I generally prefer to blend after fermentation is finished, but this was a project to use some honeys I labelled “difficult”—each had something I liked but also had at least one other character that I didn’t care for. In essence, I used them to dilute each other.
The blend included something like 11 honeys, but the four listed above comprised more than 90 percent of the total and will get you close. Not everything added was a success, frankly. Almond blossom is quite nutty, and toyon blossom is caramelly, smoky, and bitter. The heather honey—Hey, make sure it’s authentic, yeah? Lot of fake or dubious stuff out there—was also bitter, and some of the most intense floral character you’ll ever encounter. The buckwheat had heavy molasses, raisin, and fudgy characters. So again, the general theme is “too much X to use by itself, but good in a blend.”
I like D47 for traditional meads because of the flavor and mouthfeel it creates, and while some label it a “nutrient hog,” I like that it will reliably use the nutrients I feed it. Now that people are feeding their meads, I too often find they are left with a residual nutrient character that tastes gross. Fermented in the 60s Fahrenheit (upper teens Celsius), racked off sediment a couple times, and aged 1.5 years, before 1 gallon was briefly aged on medium-toast French oak and blended back in to taste.",

HONEY
36 lb. (16.3 kg) dark wildflower honey
24 lb. (10.9 kg) eastern buckwheat honey
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
30 lb. (13.6 kg) dried Turkish figs
1 Tbsp. cloves
1 tsp. allspice
36 g Go-Ferm (1.5 g per g of yeast)
43 g DAP, divided into three 14 g additions
45 g Fermaid K, divided into three 15 g staggered additions

24 g Uvaferm 43
Specifications:
Yield: 12 US gal
Original Gravity: 1.209
Final Gravity: 1.041
ABV: 16.30%","Directions:
Day 1
Make a 1.120 (28°Bx) honey starter using Uvaferm 43 yeast rehydrated with Go-Ferm.
Day 2
In a honey mixing vessel (something large enough to hold the entire volume of must, but not your fermenter), prepare your honey must with dark wildflower honey and buckwheat honey to 1.209 (45.8°Bx). You’ll likely need to use 5.5–6 gal. (20.8–22.7 L) water with the 60 lb. (27.2 kg) of honey. Later you’ll slowly transfer this must to the fermenter (see below). Add Opti-White at 1.9 g/gal. and FT Blanc tannin at 0.3 g/gal.
Add the yeast starter to the vessel in which you intend to ferment the entire batch (primary fermentation vessel); then add a portion of the must to the yeast starter in the primary fermenter, about 10–20 percent of the must. Be aware that you will eventually need to have enough room in the fermenter for the figs, about 12 gal. (45.4 L) total.
After yeast activity is noted (in about 1–2 hours), add another 10–20% of the total must to the primary fermenter. Repeat until all of the honey must has been transferred from the honey mixing vessel to the primary fermentation vessel (within 24 hours).
Day 3
Add 14 g DAP and 15 g Fermaid K (dissolve both of these in a small amount of water first to prevent foaming), stir to mix thoroughly, and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Day 4
Add 14 g DAP, 15 g Fermaid K, and dried Turkish figs. Stir to mix thoroughly and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Day 5
“Punch down” figs that are floating on the surface to mix and prevent mold.
Day 6
Add 14 g DAP and 15 g Fermaid K, stir to mix thoroughly, and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Days 7–21
At least once a day, “punch down” figs that are floating on the surface to mix and prevent mold.
Day 22
Remove figs, and place into a wine press. Press to remove as much liquid as possible. There will be some volume loss. Even though I started with 12 gal. (45.g L) of must, I was down to 10 gal. (37.9 L) or so due to absorption by the dried figs. Alternatively, you could strain instead of press, but the volume loss will be much greater.
Day 22 to 3 months
Add the cloves and allspice (I eventually racked off these spices a few weeks later). Allow any additional fermentation to complete for a few more weeks. Uvaferm 43 is a strong and steady, but slow, fermenter, especially towards the end If excess sediment forms, rack carefully off of any deep gross lees (fine lees are acceptable, though). By month 3, I had transferred most of the batch into a 8-gallon (30.3 L) neutral oak barrel. I reserved the extra leftover 2 gal. (7.6 L) for topping up later.
Month 3 and beyond
Allow to age slowly, occasionally taking small samples to taste and make sure all is proceeding as expected. Top up if needed. Rack off, sulfite (if you choose to do so), and bottle when done.
Additional Notes
Because of the high sugar concentration, there is always a chance of a stuck fermentation. Monitor progress of fermentation closely—if there are any signs of stuck fermentation, be ready to address by adding yeast hulls and making up a restart batch.
I used a neutral oak barrel that had already been used for three previous batches. I was not trying to get much oak flavor; rather I wanted to achieve the micro-oxidation Polish Dwójniak is known for.
Alternatively, you could age in a bucket or carboy, but it may be more challenging to achieve the intentional controlled oxidation we are aiming for. The goal is to age in the barrel for at least 2 to 5 years before sulfiting and bottling (I have not yet added sulfites as this batch is still aging in the barrel). Fining agents are typically not needed, as the tannins from the oak help with clarification, and the long-term aging itself allows the mead to become very clear over time. If there are any signs of over-oxidation or VA (volatile acidity), remove from the barrel immediately and treat with high-dose sulfites at 50–100 ppm.",

Freeze and then thaw cherries (measure Brix readings for each type) and place fruit into fermenter. Add Lallzme EX-V and Opti-Red according to instructions on packages. Wait 24 hours, add FT Rouge Berry tannins, and then add and blend honey on top of fruit. Make sure to take a Brix reading of your honey so you can estimate gravity calculations. At this point wait another 24 hours before pitching yeast to give honey time to blend well with the fruit and juice.
Rehydrate 25 g yeast with 33 g Go-Ferm and 650 mL spring water at 104°F (40°C). After 20 minutes, add an equal amount of must into the rehydrated yeast mixture and wait 20 more minutes to make sure yeast is active and happy. Repeat as needed to temper yeast to within 10°F (6°C) of must temperature. When that’s the case, pitch yeast into must.
24 hours after pitch, begin yeast nutrient additions. For this mead, I just did one pitch of 14.3 g Ferm-K and skipped the TOSNA protocol.
At this point, monitor fermentation and punch the fruit cap down into the must daily. After a few weeks, as fermentation slows, rack fruit off the must and strain it through a colander. Press the fruit to squeeze out extra juice and then rack mead back into carboy with the remainder of the juice. Continue fermentation until complete. Clear the mead using finings (my choice is kieselsol, then chitosan an hour later—Super Kleer packages have both).
Let the mead rest a week to settle and clear. Once cleared, rack off once more to another clean, sanitized carboy and add 8 cubes of medium-toast American oak. Age until it achieves the flavor you like.",

This recipe is written for a 1-gallon (3.8 L) batch, but you can make it whatever volume you like by scaling the quantities accordingly. Remember to include the volume of the honey in your water calculations—12 pounds of honey occupies one gallon (1.44 kg/L).

Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gal
Original Gravity: 1.112 (26.4°Bx)
Final Gravity: 1.045 (11.2°Bx)","Directions:
Mix honey and water and cool must to pitching temperature. Pitch yeast and add pure O₂ for 30 seconds through a 0.5-micron stone (a stir whip on a drill works just as well and will keep you from over-oxygenating). Ferment at 60°F (16°C).
Add nutrients in four additions: (1) when active fermentation began, (2) at 1.100 SG (23.8°Bx), (3) at 1.086 SG (20.7°Bx), and (4) at 1.074 SG (18°Bx). The last of these is the ⅓ sugar break. You don’t need to be quite this exact, as long as you stagger the additions. However, I find making additions by gravity preferable to staggering by the clock. A sluggish start or fast fermentation could cause you to unintentionally front-load or miss the points when your yeast needs some nitrogen. That said, a lot of great meadmakers do it by time intervals, so do what works best for you.
I like to keep my nutrients in small, sealable, plastic fridge containers. Then I just add a little distilled water, shake it up, and add that to the fermenter. You can do this with a plastic zip-top bag, too. You want to know your yeast’s nitrogen requirements so you can adjust the amount of nutrient accordingly. You can usually find this information on the manufacturer’s website.
If you degas, do so twice a day for the first week—make sure to do this before adding any nutrients or you’ll have some great mead all over your floor. If you do a 1-gallon batch in a glass jug, I’ve found the yellow tops of the 1 lb. honey bears from the grocery store fit nicely on the top of the jug. Simply shake the fermenter and pop the top a few times to let out the CO₂.
Crash fermentation to 30°F (–1°C) at 1.045 (11.2°Bx). I usually have a ballpark final gravity target when I make a mead, and I start tasting when it reaches that mark. When I think it shows enough of the balance and flavor I want, I crash it. You could also dial down the original gravity to 1.066 (16.1°Bx), ferment dry, and then back-sweeten to your taste if that’s the way you want to go.
Use potassium sulfate and potassium metabisulfite to stabilize and Super-Kleer KC to clarify. Let it sit about a month at 30°F (–1°C) until you can read a sheet of text through it and then bottle. I transfer to a keg and then use a bottling gun.
I keep this one still, but I think pétillant would be very nice, too. The yeast really makes the vanilla notes pop, and it has a very soft mouthfeel that keeps the body from feeling heavy or sticky. The flavor is pleasantly balanced, with enough acid to make this very drinkable. I really dig this honey and definitely recommend checking out Yirsa Farms. This could be a good platform for a very nice metheglin as well.

Specifications:
Yield: 6 US gallons
Original Gravity: 1.121
Final Gravity: 1.020
ABV: 13%","Directions:
The honey should be of good quality—your mead will have flavors of the honey you use. If you like the subtle background flavors of the honey, it should make good mead.
Nutrients need to be dissolved in either must or water before being added to the larger volume of fermenting must. Stir or swirl your must gently before adding the nutrients to remove CO2 and avoid a honey volcano.
Mix water and honey well (I attach a blender to a drill and have my honey at liquid stage before starting). Gravity should be around 1.120. By mixing vigorously, you will oxygenate the must well, which is beneficial to yeast at this time.
Rehydrate yeast with Go-Ferm, add to room-temperature honey mixture, and allow to ferment for 24 hours. At 12 hours, you can mix the must again to introduce additional oxygen. After 24 hours of fermentation, add 5.1 g Fermaid O. At 48 hours, add remaining Fermaid O. At 72 hours, add 5.7 g Fermaid K and 7.1 g DAP. Add remaining Fermaid K and DAP when 1/3 of available sugars have been fermented (SG 1.080)
When your mead is done fermenting (several weeks)—specific gravity of about 1.025—transfer to new carboy for clarifying. You can add 1 Campden tablet (potassium metabisulfite) per gallon of mead and ½ tsp. potassium sorbate per gallon to stabilize fermentation and prevent renewed fermentation. If you want to avoid these, you will need to let your mead stabilize longer to make sure fermentation is complete and avoid bottle bombs.","Bochet Variation
Bochet uses caramalized honey rather than traditional raw honey.
For Caramelized Honey
Sucrose caramelizes at 320°F (160°C) and fructose at 230°F (110°C). Honey is approximately 38.2% fructose and 1.3% sucrose (with another 31.3% glucose). If you plan to make a 6-gallon batch of bochet, then you may want to caramelize in a large kettle over a controlled flame. You will need a container of at least twice the volume of honey you want to caramelize, as it will expand and foam up as it heats. I prefer to do mine in smaller batches in the oven, as I feel I have more control and do not have to sit over the heat as long. Use a candy thermometer to keep close attention to temperatures!
Oven 325°F (163°C) for 75 minutes. Watch temperature with thermometer so it doesn’t go above 275–280°F (135–138°C). Add a small amount of water to the honey as this helps early burning of your honey (the water will boil away). When the honey is about 270°F (132°C), it will be dark brown and start to get nice caramel notes. At 280°F (138°C) you will start to get some slight burnt notes, and the honey will be quite dark brown. By 290°F (143°C), you will have significant burnt notes and it will be nearly black.
Several other methods (flame, stovetop, slow cooker, pressure cooker) can be found online, so use whichever method works best for you. Generally, the upper temperatures will be the same for all methods. Caramelized honey is good; burnt honey is harsh and bitter, so watch that temperature closely."

3 lb. (1.4 kg) honey
0.75 gal. (2.8 L) water, reverse osmosis, or spring
0.17 oz. (5 g) DV10 dry yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) Go-Ferm, dissolved in 4.2 fl. oz. (125 grams) of water

Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gallon
Original Gravity: 1.108 (25 Brix)","Directions:
If you do not have reverse osmosis water (RO), any potable dechlorinated water low in minerals is acceptable.
Ferment at 62°F (17°C).
Prior to pitching the yeast, oxygenate must for 30 seconds. Make sure you mix the must extremely well.
Yeast Rehydration
Yeast health is important, so Go-Ferm should be used to rehydrate the yeast. The formula is 1.25 grams of Go-Ferm per gram of yeast, so for this mead recipe it would be (5 grams × 1.25) = 6.25 grams. Calculate the amount of water by multiplying the Go-Ferm amount by 20, which would give you 125 grams of water. I only use (RO) water, which I heat to 110°F (43°C) before adding the Go-Ferm. Add the yeast at around 90°F (32°C) and then pull some must and slowly temper the yeast mixture until its temperature is within 10°F (6°C) of that of the must. Whatever you do, do not let that yeast mixture sit for more than 20 minutes without adding some must.
Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA)
Staggered nutrient additions give the yeast vital nutrients to conduct a quick and healthy fermentation. We will keep it simple and calculate the amount of Fermaid O based upon the formula [(BRIX × 10) × YAN × GALLONS] ÷ 50. DV10 is a low-YAN (yeast assimilable nitrogen) yeast, hence the 0.75 factor for YAN. For this batch, it would be [(25 × 10) × 0.75 × 1] ÷ 50 = 3.75 grams of Fermaid O in four doses, which would be 1 gram per feeding. You will add 1 gram of Fermaid O at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pitching the yeast. If you are going to ferment cooler than 60°F (16°C) or warmer than 70°F (21°C), I suggest you change the YAN factor to 1.25.
Stabilizing
Before we add additional honey for back sweetening, you need to stabilize the mead so fermentation does not restart. To do that, you will add 1 gram of potassium metabisulfite and 2 grams of potassium sorbate. Mix these with a little water and then pour the mixture into the mead. Let this sit for 24 hours before you back sweeten. Technically, this should be done based upon pH, but if you do not have the ability to measure pH, I assure you the above calculations will be solid.
Back Sweetening
Say you would like your finished mead to have a final gravity of 1.020 (semi-sweet). That means you need to add 20 gravity points (1.020 – 1.00 = 0.020) to the finished mead. Divide those 20 gravity points by 35 (honey has 35 points per pound per gallon) to get 20 ÷ 35 = 0.57. You probably have around 0.85 gallons that need to be sweetened. Multiply the gallons of mead you want sweetened by this ratio, 0.85 × 0.57 = 0.48 pounds of honey. Mix that with some RO water and add this mixture to your mead after it has been stabilized.",

Yeast health is important, so Go-Ferm should be used to rehydrate the yeast. The formula is 1.25 grams of Go-Ferm per gram of yeast, so for this mead recipe it would be (5 grams × 1.25) = 6.25 grams. You calculate the amount of water by multiplying the Go-Ferm amount by 20, which would give you 125 grams of water. I only use reverse osmosis (RO) water, which I heat to 110°F (43°C) before adding the Go-Ferm. Add the yeast at around 90°F (32°C) and then pull some must and slowly temper the yeast mixture until its temperature is within 10°F (6°C) of that of the must. Whatever you do, do not let that mixture sit for more than 20 minutes without adding some must.
Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA)
Staggered nutrient additions give the yeast vital nutrients to conduct a quick and healthy fermentation. We will keep it simple and calculate the amount of Fermaid-O based upon the formula [(BRIX × 10) × YAN × GALLONS] ÷ 50. DV10 is a low-YAN (yeast assimilable nitrogen) yeast, hence the 0.75 factor for YAN. For this batch, it would be [(25 × 10) × 0.75 × 1] ÷ 50 = 3.75 grams of Fermaid-O in four doses, which would be 1 gram per feeding. You will add 1 gram of Fermaid-O at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pitching the yeast. If you are going to ferment cooler than 60°F (16°C) or warmer than 70°F (21°C), I suggest you change the YAN factor to 1.25.
Stabilizing
Before we add additional honey for back sweetening, you need to stabilize the mead so fermentation does not restart. To do that, you will add 1 gram of potassium metabisulfite and 2 grams of potassium sorbate. Mix these with a little water and then pour the mixture into the mead. Let this sit for 24 hours before you back sweeten. Technically, this should be done based upon pH, but if you do not have the ability to measure that, I assure you the above calculations will be solid.
Back Sweetening
Say you would like your finished mead to have a final gravity of 1.020 (semi-sweet). That means you need to add 20 gravity points (1.020 – 1.00 = 0.020) to the finished mead. Divide those 20 gravity points by 35 (honey has 35 points per pound per gallon) to get 20 ÷ 35 = 0.57. You probably have around 0.85 gallons that need to be sweetened. Multiply the gallons of mead you want sweetened by this ratio, 0.85 × 0.57 = 0.48 pounds of honey. Mix that with some RO water and add this mixture to your mead after it has been stabilized.",

HONEY
10 lb. (4.54 kg) wildflower honey
10 lb. (4.54 kg) clover honey
2.5 lb. (1.13 kg) avocado blossom honey
1.5 lb. (680 g) buckwheat honey

Yield: 6 US gal. (22.7 L)
Original Gravity: 1.147 (33.6°P)
Final Gravity: 1.025 (6.3°P)
ABV: 16%","Directions:
Mix Go-Ferm into 8 oz. (240 mL) of 110°F (43°C) water. Let temperature fall to 104°F (40°C) or lower, add yeast, and stir gently. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix honey with enough hot water to liquify it in fermenter. Top off to 1 cup (240 mL) short of 5 gal. (18.9 L) with cold water. Mix well. Take a gravity measurement. Stir the yeast slurry. Add a couple of ounces (30–60 mL) of the mead must to the yeast slurry and allow to sit 5 minutes. Once the temperature difference between the yeast slurry and the must is less than 18°F (10°C), add the yeast slurry to the must. Seal the container and affix an airlock. Place in a cool 65°F (18°C) room. Signs of fermentation should be apparent within 8–12 hours, with rapid airlock activity expected within a day or so. On days 1, 2, and 3, open the fermenter and vigorously stir the mead to remove CO2 prior to adding nutrients. This is also the time to measure gravity. Add Fermaid-K and DAP on days 1 and 2. Add Fermaid-K, DAP, and yeast hulls on day 3 and when ⅓ of the sugar has been consumed, i.e. specific gravity has fallen to around 1.072 (17.5°P). No additional effort is then needed until airlock activity subsides. When activity subsides, check gravity. A stable (same value over days or weeks) gravity measurement at or near the estimated final value indicates that fermentation is complete.",

Use the citrus peel you prefer: half an orange or lemon, a whole tangerine, a quarter of a grapefruit, etc. Just use the outer colored part; remove the white inner pith, which can be very bitter. Please choose organic citrus. The peel will boil and soak in your beverage for some time, and it’s difficult to completely clean pesticide residues from the peel.
Fear not if you have no “warm fountains” as Digbie suggests—filtered tap or spring water will do just fine.
Variations of this recipe offered below.","Ingredients:
HONEY
1.5 lb. (680 g) unfiltered raw local honey if you can get it
WATER
4.5 qt. (4.3 L) filtered tap or spring water
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
1 in. (2.5 cm) chunk ginger root, peeled and sliced
citrus peel
YEAST
Any basic neutral ale yeast
Specifications:","Directions:
Boil about 2 hours, uncovered, to reduce volume by 1/3. Skim any foam or debris that rises to the top (there may be very little if your honey is filtered). Add ginger and boil 15 minutes longer. Add citrus peel, remove from heat, and place lid on boil kettle to retain some volatiles.
Cool must to lukewarm with lid on. Simply leaving overnight in a cool place with the lid tightly fitted is fine if that fits your schedule. Transfer must to a clean, sanitized 1-gallon (3.8-L) or larger glass jar or small carboy, scooping or filtering the ginger and peel. As with any fermentation, be sure there is sufficient airspace for vigorous bubbling, and if using fruits or chunky spices, be sure they don’t reach and block the airlock.
Pitch yeast after the must is below about 85°F (29°C). A portion of the settled yeast from previous batches can be used—this slurry will keep at refrigerator temperature for several months. Swirl vigorously to aerate and fit with an airlock. Keep at room temperature, 60–70°F (16–21°C), for initial fermentation, which should begin within a day. Vigorous fermentation should ensue for perhaps a week, before slowing.
You can pour young, vigorously fermenting small mead directly from the fermenter into a chilled glass to drink if you don’t mind the haze. After fermentation settles down, you may choose to bottle it by racking to plastic soda or seltzer bottles and storing them in the refrigerator. Squeeze the sides of the bottles to push the liquid level up and minimize airspace. The mead will gradually clear but continue to slowly ferment. Loosen the caps to release accumulated CO2 if the bottles begin to bulge a bit.
In Digbie’s time, “stopping it very close” with cork or leather was not a hermetically sealed bottle as is possible with current caps or swing tops. Do not bottle this in modern crown-capped glass bottles! At best, opening them will create a geyser that wastes your precious small mead. At worst, your bottles will explode, potentially causing harm and also wasting your beverage. (Don’t ask me how I know this.)
If you are carrying small mead to a gathering and desire a classier presentation, transport it in a stable position to minimize jostling—chilled, in plastic soda bottles—and then transfer to a clear glass bottle with a removable stopper after arriving at your destination. A wine bottle will do, as will a clear 1-liter bottle with a swing-top closure.
This mead is best consumed within a month or two. Some bottles that I “lost” in the back of the refrigerator for a few months had definitely developed some off flavors. With the low alcohol content, there is also the possibility of growing undesirable microbial colonists over time, so drink it up soon!","Variations
MiniMaiMead
Try this version in May, or whenever local strawberries are in season. Use the basic recipe, with these changes.
Honey: use orange blossom, acacia, or linden (or any filtered, light-colored honey with a floral note)
Ginger: omit
Citrus: use peel of half a lemon
Add with citrus: 1 cup (240 mL) strawberries, halved or quartered if large (OK to leave leafy hulls on). Strain these out after cooling rather than transfer to the fermenter, as they discolor quickly.
Optional to add with citrus: one small, whole vanilla bean.
Add with yeast: about 10 stems, 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long of washed fresh or dried sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) leaves with or without blossoms.
Serve with a slice of fresh strawberry in the glass if you like.
If you can’t find or don’t care for sweet woodruff, alternative herbs include basil, lemon balm, lemon thyme, pineapple sage, chamomile, borage, and lavender (reduce the amount by half if using lavender, as it can be overpowering).
Winter is Coming Small Mead
As fall moves into winter, try this recipe, using the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: wildflower, preferably local
Ginger: omit
Citrus: peel of a tangerine or clementine
Add with citrus: 3-4 tender tips of white pine or balsam fir foliage
Add with yeast: rescue the last few rose petals or buds before the first frost; if you have no rose garden, add dried rosebuds with the citrus (try Middle Eastern markets or online) or a splash of rosewater
Figgy Pudding
Use the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: buckwheat or dark wildflower
Ginger: use slices of candied (crystalized) ginger if fresh is hard to find
Add with ginger: half a stick of cinnamon, a nubbin of nutmeg, a few blades of mace (optional), 3 or 4 dried figs, quartered, and 3 or 4 dates
Citrus: peel of half an orange
Note that the figs and dates, if they go into the fermentation vessel, will eventually settle as an unattractive (if tasty) sludge. Pour the small mead off the muck to serve or bring it out in opaque mugs rather than glasses.
For Your Honey - A Valentine’s Day Small Mead
Use the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: clover
Ginger: omit
Citrus: peel of half a lemon
Add with citrus: a few dried hibiscus flowers, or an herbal tea bag with hibiscus as a major ingredient (Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger is a good one)
Add with yeast: 1 cup (240 mL) deep red 100% fruit juice like cherry, pomegranate, or red currant"

Recipe courtesy Scott Aufderheide.
This cyser scored a 45 at the 2019 Mazer Cup when it was 6 months old. My goal was to make a Chardonnay-style cyser. Chardonnays are often dry, oaky, and barrel fermented. You could attempt a malolactic fermentation step after the initial ferment, but that was beyond my scope this time, and I think the touch of lactic acid was good enough.
Since I didn’t have a barrel, I used a lot of oak cubes in primary. The difference between fermenting on oak and using oak later is that during fermentation, the yeast will eat all of the vanillin, leaving only tannic, spicy, and smoky contributions from the oak and less vanilla and sweetness.
This mead ends up being around 11.5% ABV. While this is immediately ready to consume at the 8-week mark and quite pleasant, I found that letting it age for 6 months from pitch brought back a lot of the honey and apple flavors, and it became much more complex.
Pectic enzyme and bentonite cannot be added together because bentonite denatures the enzyme, so wait a day between additions. Bentonite in primary is easily kept in suspension by the turbulence of fermentation, making it very effective. The combination yields a very clear mead almost immediately after fermentation ends. Fermaid O and GoFerm ensure a good, healthy fermentation with all the proper nutrients for the yeast. Sorbate and metabisulfite are stabilizers and an antioxidant to make sure fermentation doesn’t restart after back-sweetening.","Ingredients:

1 Tbsp. (15 mL) pectic enzyme
2 tsp. (10 mL) bentonite
12.5 g. GoFerm
10.1 g. Fermaid O
1 Tbsp. (15 mL) potassium sorbate

Yield: 5 US gal (18.9 L)
Original Gravity: 1.085–1.095 (20.5–22.7°P)
Final Gravity: 0.995–1.000 (-1.25–0°P)
ABV: 11.50%","Directions:
Day 0 Mix 12.5 g GoFerm with about 250 mL of 110°F (43°C) water until it dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches 104°F (40°C), sprinkle yeast on top to rehydrate and leave for about 20 minutes. Mix cider and honey together until fully dissolved. Save 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of honey for back-sweetening later. Add 1 Tbsp. pectic enzyme and all of the oak to the fermenter. Pitch yeast and ferment at 62°F (17°C). Day 1 Take a few ounces of the must (possibly the same used to measure gravity), mix in 2.6 g Fermaid O, and return to primary. Add 2 tsp. bentonite by sprinkling on top (no need for the boiling water/slurry method). Days 2 and 3 Stir enough to degas some, but not enough to aerate (avoid splashing and vortices). Mix 2.5 g. of Fermaid O with a sample of must and return to primary. Day 4–7 Monitor gravity with daily hydrometer readings. On day 7, or when the gravity has fallen by 2/3 (whichever comes first), add the final 2.5 g Fermaid O feeding. Day 18 Fermentation should end between days 10 and 12. Gently stir or swirl to get everything in suspension, and cold crash for 72 hours. Day 21 Rack cyser and oak cubes from primary to secondary, and add 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite and 1 Tbsp. potassium sorbate. Day 25 Let sit for a few days, then back-sweeten with 1 lb. honey to about 1.002. A bone-dry gravity below 1.000 is generally unpleasant: here, back-sweetening is more to give a reasonable level of dryness than to actually make it sweet. Add an extra 1/4 tsp potassium metabisulfite to ensure stability. Day 35 This depends entirely on the cider you use and the effect you are going for, but I add some acid additions of 13.7 g malic and 5.5 mL lactic to sharpen the mead. The amounts will depend on the cider, the honey, and your own personal tastes. Conduct acid trials to find the right amount for your mead. Day 42 (Optional) Back-sweetening will likely have made your mead cloudy again. If it doesn’t clear on its own after a few weeks, mix 1 Tbsp. Sparkolloid with 1 cup boiling water and stir while boiling for 5 minutes. Add this to the mead and gently but thoroughly mix it in. You do not have to do this step if you are happy with the clarity of your mead. Let sit for 2 weeks. Day 56 At this point, the mead has been 8 weeks on the oak. I think this is the minimum: I get a good tannic character without it being too oaky, but if you’d like to leave it on the cubes longer it should be fine. Otherwise, keg or bottle. If kegging, store at room temp and serve at 2 to 3 psi (140–200 mbar) to make sure it doesn’t carbonate.",

Recipe courtesy Scott Aufderheide
Session-style meads are notoriously difficult because they often taste weak and watery. Blueberries are a great fruit for this style because they have good natural tannins and some acidity. If you taste this after it ferments to completion but before you back-sweeten, you might be surprised by the lack of blueberry flavor. That’s because some sugar needs to be present for the blueberry flavor to properly assert itself and be recognized.
You may think 20 lb. of blueberries is a lot, but 3 lb. per gallon is actually the standard. I went with 4 lb. per gallon for added flavor and presence. The measured original gravity may be much lower than the true original gravity since the sugar in the berries takes time to release.
A 6.5% ABV mead might not seem very sessionable. But again, because it’s hard to get good flavor in a session mead, enough honey needs to be added to make a good impression. Oak adds structure and flavor and rounds out the edges quickly after fermentation.
Back-sweetening gives general body and added flavor. The target sweetness of 1.015 is a good medium point—it isn’t overly sweet thanks to the balancing effects of berry and oak tannins and carbonation. All the components of this recipe have been targeted and used to make a nicely balanced and flavorful session mead that’s hard to put down (hence “vice” in the name). Make tweaks at your own risk, or at least consider their effect on balance.
Pectic enzyme and bentonite cannot be added together because bentonite denatures the enzyme, so wait a day between additions. Bentonite in primary is easily kept in suspension by the turbulence of fermentation, making it very effective. The combination yields a very clear mead almost immediately after fermentation ends. Fermaid O and GoFerm ensure a good, healthy fermentation with all the proper nutrients for the yeast. Sorbate and metabisulfite are stabilizers and an antioxidant to make sure fermentation doesn’t restart after back-sweetening.","Ingredients:
FERMENTABLES
20 lb. (9.07 kg) blueberries
8 lb. (3.63 kg) wildflower honey
OTHER INGREDIENTS
2 oz. (57 g) medium toast American oak cubes
1 Tbsp. (15 mL) pectic enzyme
2 tsp. (10 mL) bentonite
6.25 g GoFerm
7.9 g Fermaid O
1 Tbsp. (15 mL) potassium sorbate
0.5 tsp. (2.5 mL) potassium metabisulfite
YEAST
5 g Lalvin ICV-D47 yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5 US gal (18.9 L)
Original Gravity: 1.045–1.050 (11.25–12.5°P)
Final Gravity: 0.995–1.000 (−1.25–0°P)
ABV: 5.9-7.2%","Directions:
To prep, freeze your blueberries for at least 24 hours. Then pick out and discard any that have mold or look off, although smashed berries are fine. Possibly grab an extra pound to compensate for the loss of these throwaways. Day 0 Mix 6.25 g Goferm with about 125 mL of 110°F (43°C) water until it dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches 104°F (40°C), sprinkle yeast on top to rehydrate and leave for about 20 minutes. Of your 8 lb. (3.63 kg) of honey, mix 5 lb. (2.27 kg) in with 2.5 gallons (9.46 L) of warm water to dissolve. Save the remaining 3 lb. (1.36 kg) for back-sweetening later. Place berries in a mesh bag for easy removal later. Add the bag to the fermenter and fill with more water to reach 6 gal. (22.71 L). The berries will take up about 2–2.5 gallons (7.5–9.5 L) of space. Add 1 Tbsp. pectic enzyme to break down the pectin in the berries. When yeast solution is ready, ensure it is within 10°F (6°C) of must temperature before pitching. Acclimatize the yeast if needed by adding a tablespoon of the must to the yeast slurry every 30 to 60 seconds. Ferment at 62°F (17°C). If you are unable to keep berries submerged completely during fermentation, periodically open the fermenter and push them down to keep them wet. Do this at least every other day. Day 1 Take a few ounces of the must (possibly the same used for the gravity measurement), mix in 7.9 g of Fermaid O, and return to primary. Attempt to degas some by stirring, but the bag of fruit can make this difficult. Add 2 tsp. bentonite by just sprinkling it on top (no need for the boiling water/slurry method). Day 14 Fermentation should have finished between days 8 and 10. Remove the berry bag and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Ideally you will have between 5 and 5.25 gallons (about 19–20 liters) at a gravity of 0.995–1.000. Cold crash for 3 days. Day 17 Rack into secondary vessel. I like to use glass carboys to reduce headspace and to observe clearing. Whatever you use should be more air tight than an ale pail. Add 1 Tbsp. potassium sorbate, 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite, and 2 oz. medium toast American oak cubes. Age 6–8 weeks to try to get the most out of your oak: longer is fine, but this is the minimum. Around Day 65 Rack to a keg and add the remaining 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite. Warm the remaining 3 lb. honey to loosen it, and add it to the keg to back-sweeten to about 1.015. Let keg sit at room temperature for 24–48 hours, shaking occasionally, to ensure the honey is completely dissolved. Chill keg with a CO2 head pressure of 8–10 psi (0.6–0.7 bar) for 1 week to carbonate.",

In a 3-5 gallon fermenter, mix together the 10.5 lbs of Mesquite honey, Tart cherry juice, Opti-Red, FT Rouge, and top up with spring water to hit 3 gallon mark if needed. Once GoFerm mixture is at 104 °F, pitch the 71b yeast in to it and cover with a cloth for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes have passed uncover and temperate it by adding 5 mL of your must every few minutes. Do this until it is within 10 °F of your must and then pitch the yeast slurry in to your must.  Add 3 grams of Fermaid-O at 24, 48, and 72 hours . Then add the remainder at the 1/3rd sugar break or on the 7th day, whichever comes first. Stirring the mead with a wine whip is recommended twice a day for the first 10 days.  Once the gravity is stable and the mead is no longer fermenting rack to secondary on top of the 4 cans of Oregon Fruit Tart Cherries, liquid and all. The mead may start fermenting again which is fine. Once the primary fermentation is completely finished rack to tertiary, stabilize with sulfites and sorbate, and after 24 hours add the Avocado Blossom honey to taste or until it is at the Semi-Sweet level. Also adjust tannins and acids at this time to bring the mead into balance.  Bulk age for 2-3 months until clear and ready to bottle.

Feel free to experiment with all-grain variants of this. You can stick to the lighter malts, which are the most commonly used when people make large amounts of t’alla for celebrations. For more complex flavors, try steeping teff, maize, wheat, and/or sorghum with the wort. If you want to mimic the smoky flavor of the traditional t’alla vessel, you might try substituting in some darker malt. This recipe uses honey, which many forms of t’alla call for. The key ingredient is gesho in place of hops.","Ingredients:

Making wonderful mead is part science and part art. The science comes into play with recipe development, quality honey, yeast management through staggered nutrient additions, and appropriate fermentation temperature. The art comes into play post-fermentation. Unfortunately, mastering the art of meadmaking often can’t be described in a written recipe, and rather must be honed through experience and experimentation. Mix 14 lb. (6.35 kg) Mexican coffee blossom honey, 4 gal. (15.14 L) of 60°F (16°C) water, and 0.56 oz. (15 g) bentonite in a sanitized ale pail. OG should be around 1.100 with a volume of around 5.2 gal. (19.7 L), and temperature should be under 65°F (18°C). Add 0.5 ounces (14 g) of medium toast French oak cubes. Prepare yeast by mixing 0.69 oz. (19.5 g) Go-Ferm with 13.2 fl. oz. (390 mL) of 110°F (43°C) water. When the mixture’s temperature drops to under 104°F (40°C), sprinkle 0.53 oz. (15 g) of Lavlin D47 yeast and let sit for 15 minutes. After that time is up, give the yeast a vigorous stir and begin tempering yeast mixture to must temperature by adding 3.4 fl. oz. (100 mL) of must to the yeast every 5 minutes or so until the yeast mixture reaches 70°F (21°C). Oxygenate with pure O2 for about 60 seconds. Pitch yeast mixture, seal fermenter with an airlock, and ferment at 60°F (16°C). Add 0.18 oz. (5 g) Fermaid-O and 0.05 oz. (1.5 g) DAP in three separate feedings at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after pitching yeast. Ferment to a gravity of 1.000, and the mead will be nearly crystal clear thanks to the bentonite. Dissolve the label-recommended dose of potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate in 6.8 fluid oz. (200 mL) of hot water and add this to a sanitized 5 gal. (18.9 L) carboy. Rack mead on to this solution. Fill the carboy completely, leaving all of the primary sediment behind. A week later, back-sweeten to 1.035 (8.8°P) with about 5 lb. (2.27 kg) additional honey. Pour this honey into another sanitized 5-gallon fermenter and rack the mead over it. Stir to mix, and wait at least 2 weeks to fully incorporate. Pull a sample to verify gravity is around 1.035 and replace that volume with SuperKleer (again, per the label instructions). After a few more weeks, the mead will be extremely clear, with a small layer of gunk on the bottom of the carboy. Rack into another carboy (dosing with a bit more potassium metabisulfite) and top off with a bit more water if needed. Add 0.2 g/L tartaric acid, or to taste, to brighten the flavor, or do bench trials with smaller volumes and scale up to the full batch. Bottle in regular brown beer bottles with crown caps.",

Michael Wilcox of Wichita, KS, member of the Kansas City Bier Meisters, won a gold medal in Category #32: Spice & Specialty Mead during the 2019 National Homebrew Competition Final Round in Providence, RI with the help of Scot Schaar & Carvin Wilson. Wilcox’s Poltorak-inspired mead, a blend of 5 different meads, was chosen as the best among 149 entries in the category and earned him the title of 2019 Meadmaker of the Year.","Ingredients:

The winning mead in Category 32 was a blend of five meads made by three talented meadmakers. It is impossible to reproduce. Here, Wilcox describes what each mead contributed to the blend. Dwojniak/Poltorak with Raisins (Michael Wilcox) “The closest I’ve ever come to making a true Poltorak (2:1 honey to water ratio), this mead is in the range of 1.120 to 1.130 final gravity. I don’t remember what yeast it used, but I currently recommend Uvaferm 43 for all big Polish-style meads anyway. Between 1 and 1.5 pounds of raisins were used per gallon of mead, most in primary, and most were caramelized and mashed a bit on my stovetop before they went into the fermenter. (Yes, at this point, raisins are nutrients!) Make sure you’re using non-sulfited fruit. The honey is my typical blend of mostly acacia with a bit of non-enteric buckwheat: something in the 3:1 or 4:1 ratio is fine. It was never sulfited and has oxidized brilliantly. This mead is in the range of seven years old now, and really TOO sweet anymore on its own, but in this blend it brings up the richness for the rest of the batch. It spent significant time wood aging, including, for a time, a stay in what I had previously aged my attempts at Madeira in. There is chocolate and molasses and caramelized sugar here, tons of raisin, other dried fruit, a bit of nuttiness, and I do believe it picked up a bit of booziness from the Madeira. Lots of second-use oak, nothing too overt, lots of edges rounded with time and residual sugar.” Oxidized Mesquite Traditional Mead (Michael Wilcox) “Step fed, sack, and fermented with Lalvin K1V-1116 at around 70°F, to about 18% ABV. Finished at about 1.045. Big alcohol originally, but quite smooth now. Unintentionally oxidized with significant nutty (most would say walnut) character coming through. Several years old. This batch of mesquite also has a very woody character. After talking with a few others, we guess that something like creosote blooming around the same time may be giving this character. Whatever it is, it is a welcome character that I’m always looking for when I buy honey from the US Southwest. Adds alcohol, pronounced nuttiness, a woody, vaguely smoky character, and emphasizes honey.” Sweet Mead with Dates (Carvin Wilson) “This fruit character was the missing component that raisin and fig alone weren’t getting me. Beautiful honey character too, sort of a woody and clove-like spiciness, which could also be from the yeast Carvin chose. Fermented with AMH (Enoferm’s Assmanhausen): treat this yeast well, slowly introducing it to your must without shocking it with huge gravity or temperature changes, fermenting in the 70s Fahrenheit, following proper nutrient protocol, and it will treat you well in return. The dates are Deglet and Medjool, totaling about 5 pounds per gallon. If you don’t have access to that amount of dates or can’t spend that much, Carvin thinks one can approximate this mead with a single pound of dates added after primary with a clean yeast. A mix of mesquite and avocado blossom honeys was used, with an OG in the range of 1.160, and the mead was already 5 years old when I blended with it.” Dwojniak with Dried Fruits and Walnuts (Scot Schaar) “This is the mead you may have heard earned Scot his ‘Polish passport’ from a group of incredibly talented Polish meadmakers visiting the USA during Mazer Cup 2019. They told him, ‘You are one of us now.’ Awesome. This mead is big on walnut, which is almost exactly like a common oxidation character, and Scot has allowed it to oxidize for good measure. This mead emphasizes the aged and nutty quality of the blend and helps balance the less sweet components of the mead. In an approximately 3-gallon batch, a 1:1 ratio of honey is used, so 1.5 gallons of water, 12 pounds (1 gallon) of wildflower honey, and 6 pounds of bamboo honey. It was fermented with Uvaferm 43 yeast with temperatures in the mid to upper 60s Fahrenheit. Head space was left in secondary to encourage oxidation. Fourteen months after pitching and after 10 months in secondary, 8 ounces of dried black currants, 12 ounces of white figs, 12 ounces of black mission figs, and 2 pounds of chopped walnuts were added. Alcohol is in the 15% range, and final gravity is unknown, but I expect something in the 1.090 range would get you close. The mead is almost three years old at this point.” Sweet Mead with Figs and Bamboo Honey (Scot Schaar) “This mead won Scot the 2017 Meadmaker of the Year award. It was printed in Zymurgy two years ago, so go look it up. The heavier, richer, vaguely molasses-like, a-bit-like-buckwheat-honey nature of the bamboo honey was welcome. The figs just emphasize the dark fruit, dried fruit, and oxidized characters and don’t stick out as much as the other fruit in the final blend, but you’d notice the difference if I left them out. This mead also gave the blend a championship pedigree I thought we could use.”",

Mead Day 2019 Official Recipe
Try your hand at this semi-sweet mead made with Madagascar vanilla bean and Saigon and Vietnamese cinnamon. Prairie Rose Meadery in Fargo, N.D. suggests pairing this with almost any sweet dessert. We think a Mexican hot chocolate cake would be perfect!","Ingredients:
20 lb Clover honey
3 gal Water, charcoal filtered
2 pkgs Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
12.5 g GoFerm
10 g Fermaid O
10 g Fermaid K
6.6 g Diammonium phosphate (DAP)
1 Madagascar vanilla bean
3 Saigon/Vietnamese cinnamon sticks
Fining/Clarifying agent
Specifications:
Yield: 6 gallons
Original Gravity: 1.128
Final Gravity: 1.020|1.020
ABV: ~14%","Directions:
Heat water to around 110° F to help the honey mix in well. Add enough honey to reach gravity of 1.128. Cool must (unfermented mead) to 67° F. Rehydrate 2 packets (10 grams) of Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast in 115° F water with 12.5 grams of GoFerm. Let sit for about 20 minutes until foamy and add to must. Aerate wort either by stirring rapidly or directly adding O2 for a few minutes until the must is foamy. Nutrient Schedule IMPORTANT: The times noted are hours after the yeast was pitched. Also, before adding any dry nutrients, swirl the must to remove any CO2. This will help you avoid violent volcano-like activity in your must. Repeat this process before every nutrient addition.
12 hours: oxygenate the must again
24 hours: add 5 grams of Fermaid O
48 hours: add 5 grams of Fermaid O
72 hours: add 5 grams Fermaid K and 3.3 grams DAP
When gravity drops to around 1.086: add 5 grams Fermaid K and 3.3 grams DAP
If the pH drops below 3.3, add Potassium Carbonate (0.25 – 0.5 tsp). Test and bring up the pH to about 3.45. The mead should be done fermenting in about 3 weeks. When fermentation is complete, add 1 Madagascar Vanilla Bean and 3 Saigon/Vietnamese Cinnamon sticks. Let sit for about 1 week – tasting every few days.  When flavor is at a pleasant level to you, remove the vanilla bean and cinnamon sticks. Rack to a new carboy and fine using Super Clear or other fining agent. If bottling, add potassium sorbate/potassium meta-bisulfite to stabilize.  If kegging this isn’t needed.",

In early May 2008, Charlie Papazian, along with his wife and close friends, ventured out to London to fulfill a desire to taste very old mead. Charlie and company were lucky enough to try some meads from 1947, 1948, and 1949. The seventh mead he tried on his mead-journey was a 1949 Gulval Bochet, which he noted had no sediment or indications that fruit had been used in the recipe, so it must've been 100-percent honey mead. And that it was!
The deep copper color and vanilla-like aroma were accompanied by a well-integrated, toffee-textured, sherry-like character. The group later discovered that bochet refers to ""burnt mead,"" which would explain the toffee-like character and deep color. As Charlie said, ""The three-day tasting experience was grueling, but someone had to do it.""","Ingredients:
18.5 lb. (8.2 kg) light honey
4 g yeast extract or appropriate amount of other yeast nutrient as recommended by your local homebrew supply shop
0.1 g zinc-fortified yeast as nutrient
3 Tbsp. (40 g) dried Champagne or mead yeast (Prise de Mousse or other Champagne yeast is an excellent choice)
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.130–1.138
Final Gravity: 1.028–1.038
ABV: ~14%","Directions:
Add honey to a pot. Do not add water. Gently boil the honey until it has turned dark and tastes caramelized. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and zinc-fortified yeast, and blend into “scorched” honey. Add this hot honey and water mixture to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in your primary fermenter. Add more cold water as needed to achieve 5 gallons total volume. Aerate extremely well and add dissolved yeast nutrient (yeast extract). When temperature is below 80° F (26.5° C) add rehydrated yeast. Mead is best initially fermented between 70 and 75° F (21–24° C). Ferment until activity is very low; this may take three weeks to three months. Rack to secondary fermenter. Secondary can be stored at cooler temperatures. Rack off sediment after six months to a year. Bottle when clear and all fermentation has ceased. Cork in wine bottles for long-term aging. If using beer bottles or Champagne bottles that can accept bottle caps, dip capped bottle top in melted paraffin to inhibit air ingress into bottle. Best after 50 years, but worth indulging in when you and the mead are ready.",

“This was an experimental rescue mead. In general, however, here’s a description of the train wreck and subsequent rescue attempt. The mead stalled in primary. Despite adjusting the pH and pitching more yeast, it would not drop below about 1.060. The yeast was probably 71B, but I also re-pitched Champagne and others in a vain attempt to restart fermentation. At that point, I needed to empty my Flanders red barrel, so in went the mead for about six months just to see what would happen. It dropped some more points, but not much.

Fill up a clean and sanitized primary fermenter half way with water. Add the honey and stir or shake until the honey is nearly fully dissolved. Add enough water to reach 5 gallons and mix or shake again until the honey is fully dissolved in the water. If the must (term for unfermented mead) appears to stratify after settling, keep on mixing! Next, take the time to conduct proper procedures to rehydrate dry yeast prior to pitching. Once rehydrated, pitch the yeast and nutrient into the must and seal the fermenter with an airlock. Hold fermentation in the range of 60-70°F (15.5-21°C), with lower temperatures being more favorable. Primary fermentation should be nearly complete after three weeks, at which point the mead can be racked to a secondary vessel for bulk aging.

Submerse the honey containers in hot water to loosen the honey, which will make it easier to dissolve. Partially or totally thaw the fruit. Sanitize all equipment used for making your mead. Mash the bagged fruit with your hands. If you prefer, put all the fruit into the pail and mash with a potato masher or similar tool. Use enough honey and water to get a total volume of 4.5 to 5 gallons (excluding fruit). Honey weighs approximately 12 pounds per gallon. Put all the fruit into your fermenting pail. You will want the temperature of the mead must to be 65 to 70 °F. If the fruit is still very cold you should heat the water enough to bring the temperature of the must into that range. Add the honey and water to the pail. Use a mixing spoon or wine degasser to mix the must and completely dissolve the honey. After the honey is dissolved, stir vigorously for a few minutes to aerate the must. The must does not need heat to pasteurize the honey or fruit. Prepare your yeast by re-hydrating, following the instructions on the packets. The use of a re-hydration nutrient such as Go-Ferm is highly recommended. This will prepare the yeast for the strenuous journey ahead of them. Pitch the yeast, add the first SNA and mix well. Fermentation should begin in about 12 to 24 hours. When signs of fermentation are noticed, start managing the fruit cap and begin the SNA schedule. With some luck, fermentation will be complete in two to four weeks. Once half of the sugar is depleted, continue to punch the cap at least twice a day but refrain from introducing oxygen into the must. Allow the mead to stay in primary for 4 weeks. At that point, transfer to the secondary carboy for clarifying. Taste the mead for sweetness level. If you desire more sweetness, now is the time to adjust it. To sweeten mead, start with a cup of the mead and add honey to a level sweeter than you want. Then blend the dryer mead with the sweetened sample to get three samples that vary by 10 gravity points ranging from too sweet to not sweet enough. Taste and blend the samples until you get the sweetness level you want. Get some help with this as your palate may get fatigued. Take a gravity reading of the sample you chose. Determine the specific gravity difference between the mead and the sample. Now you can figure out how much honey you will need to sweeten the entire batch to the desired level. One pound of honey will raise one gallon of mead approximately 34 gravity points. If you have 5 gallons of mead, each pound of honey will raise the batch about 6 to 7 points. Once you determine how much honey you need to add to the batch, use 1 cup of boiled water per pound of honey to dilute the honey. Pour the mixture into the carboy and mix until evenly dispersed. Take a sample and see if further adjustment is needed. Take caution to keep from over-sweetening the batch. It’s much harder to make it drier! After a month or two if the mead is not clear, transfer again and use a two-stage clarifier such as Super-Kleer. You can also use relatively inexpensive plastic filters with filter pads, pumping the mead from one keg, through the filer to a second keg. You will be amazed by the amount of fruit debris and insect parts on the filter pads, but your mead should be sparkling clear. One word of caution when filtering, pectin will clog a filter very quickly. You can use pectic enzyme to help remove the pectin. Two stage clarifiers do not remove pectin. Once you are completely sure there is no fermentation and the mead is clear, you can bottle. For sparkling mead, I suggest kegging and force carbonating. Bottle-conditioning sweet mead can be difficult, as well as creating exploding bottles.
Staggered Nutrient Addition (SNA)
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix immediately after pitching yeast.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix 24 hours after fermentation begins.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix 48 hours after fermentation begins.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix after 30% of the sugar has been depleted.
SNA serves many purposes for yeast health. Abundant CO2 is toxic to yeast, so mixing while adding the nutrients will release the gas. Vigorous mixing introduces oxygen needed by growing yeast. The mixing also disturbs the fruit cap (or floating fruit). Punching down the cap should be done at least three times a day during the period of vigorous fermentation. Cap management is important for releasing toxic CO2 and preventing temperature buildup below the cap. For every 1 degree reduction of brix in the must, there is approximately a 2°F increase in temperature. Unmanaged, the temperature can increase to the point of killing your yeast in the heat zone below the cap, potentially driving off the floral fruity character of your fruit. This is less of a concern in the five gallon homebrew scenario but could still be a potential problem. If the cap is not pressed down into the must it can dry out. Then, if oxygen is introduced, spoilage organisms grow and produce off flavors.","Traditional Option
Making a melomel with nearly 20 pounds of fruit can get pricy! As a cheaper alternative, forgo the fruit and juice to create a traditional mead consisting purely of honey, water and yeast. Yeast nutrients and the SNA schedule should still be followed for optimum fermentation. Take into consideration that forgoing the fruit and juice will alter specifications listed above.

Pour the honey into a large plastic fermenter. Start adding water to the fermenter. After just a couple of gallons, start stirring the mixture. Once you have a couple gallons of water and the honey mixed together, place a sanitized hydrometer in the must. Slowly add water and mix after each addition until you hit the target OG. Add 0.25 teaspoons of Fermaid K and 0.5 teaspoons of diammonium phosphate to the fermenter.
Once you have the must mixed up, rehydrate the yeast in GoFerm, following the package directions. Once rehydration is complete, mix the rehydrated yeast and liquid into the fermenter.
Once or twice a day, stir the must and push the bag of ginger back under the liquid. The stirring process will release a lot of CO2 from the must. Stir until almost no more bubbles are released by additional stirring. If stirring with a spoon, it will take a while to drive out all the CO2. Using a wand in the drill is faster, but be careful not to release so much CO2 so fast that the fermenter foams over the top.
Once a day, after a round of stirring, add the dose of nutrients, 0.25 teaspoons of Fermaid K and 0.5 teaspoons of diammonium phosphate. Do this for 3 days.
After three to four weeks, rack the mead into glass and wait for it to drop clear. Use Super-Kleer K.C. to help clarification if the mead has finished fermenting. Once clear, keg and carbonate to around 3 volumes of CO2.",

Golden Russet chosen for very high gravity and arguably my favorite apple. Northern Spy for high acid and fruit character, often pear/melon. McIntosh is sometimes described as tasting like partially fermented apples, and usually retains a noticeable “mac note” after fermentation. This fills the “tastes like apples” character many judges seem to look for. Cote des Blancs can be reliably stopped with cold temperatures but is prone to hydrogen sulfide production if it isn’t happy. For inexperienced cidermakers, I’d recommend a Champagne yeast, ferment dry, stabilize, back-sweeten, and force-carb. It’s quite acidic already, so I keep carbonation fairly low. If your juice isn’t high enough gravity, try partially freeze-concentrating it. 1.045 juice ain’t gonna get ya there…",

Recipe courtesy of Nat West, Reverend Nat’s Hard Cider
Others profess to produce a cherry cider, but none begin with 100% sour Granny Smith apples (eschewing all other apple varieties for their lack of sourness) unified with the superior Montmorency sour cherry (aka Prunus cerasus, a superior and vastly dissimilar cherry to Prunus avid, the bird cherry, the mere mazzard, so commonly used in cough syrup and children’s sweet-snacks) and the exotic Morello sour cherry (hailing from my native country of Hungary), fermented with an English Ale yeast (procured from a fine brewery in Chiswick, London), rounded out with a spot of Bartlett pear juice (undeniably the world’s greatest pear-flavored pear) and completed with a touch of spiciness (largely attributable to the ghost chili pepper, although married with a secret spice), precisely enough to make your vigor race and spirits embrace another gulp. This is a cherry cider like none you have ever tasted.","Ingredients:
JUICE
4 gal. (15.1 L) super-tart apple juice, Granny Smith if possible
1 gal. (3.8 L) tart cherry juice

ADDITIONAL ITEMS
Fermaid K
Super Kleer
10–15 cloves
Dried chiles of your choice
Specifications:
Yield: 5 US gal
ABV: 6%","Directions:
Ferment the apple juice at 62–72°F (17–22°C). Don’t let it climb above 72°F (22°C).
Add yeast nutrient—use Fermaid K, not plain old diammonium phosphate (DAP)—at 30–35% attenuation according to the dosage on the package, noting that the juice will go full dry, down to below 1.000 SG (0°P).
When fully dry, let the cider age in primary for 3 weeks. Chill, if possible, to help the yeast drop out of suspension. After 3 weeks, add Super Kleer according to the manufacturer’s instructions to clarify, and then transfer off the Super Kleer to a secondary container.
Add 1 gal. (3.8 L) of tart/sour cherry juice. Do not use “dark/sweet” cherry juice. It may be hard to find this product, but I can usually get it at Whole Foods Market. It can be much pricier than sweet juice. Look for Montmorency and/or Morello varieties. These are tart pie cherries, which are largely inedible.
Prepare clove tea by adding 10–15 cloves to a small pot with 3 cups (710 mL) of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 hour. Strain out the cloves and cool the tea (adding ice is OK). Add a quarter cup of the tea to the cider to start, and then, using ESP, stop adding the tea just before you begin to actually taste the clove in the final blended cider.
Make a tincture by soaking a couple of dried chiles in vodka for 1–3 weeks. Ghost chiles are great, as are habaneros. The hotter, the better. Be careful with this tincture! Do not use fresh chiles, as they will give a vegetal flavor and aroma. Depending on the Scoville intensity of the liquor, add an amount that produces an ever-so-slight hint of heat. It’s very easy to overdo it. Maybe get a friend to help taste it with you.",

Fire cider is similar to ice cider and is sometimes produced by the same cideries in Quebec. The goal is to concentrate the juice, but instead of freezing and thawing, it is concentrated by boiling. The method is similar to maple syrup production, but it’s much more manageable since the starting gravity of apple juice is higher than that of maple sap. Apples like Spartan, Cortland, and McIntosh are traditionally used in Quebec’s ice- and fire-cider production.
First, I pressed 90 lb. of apples to yield 6 gallons of juice at 1.065 (15.9°Bx) starting gravity. I then placed this juice into a pot on a gas stove, slowly brought it to a boil, and continued boiling on low heat. It took approximately 4.5 hours to boil down from 6 gallons to 2.5 gallons with a gravity of about 1.160 (36.2°Bx). The concentrated juice was left overnight to chill to room temperature.
At this point, I added the 3 tsp. pectic enzymes and divided the 2.5 gal. into two batches of 1.25 gal. each, which I fermented at 60˚F (16˚C) with DV10 (Champagne) and 71B-1122 (Narbonne) yeasts. I added 2 tsp. Fermaid O to each batch on the first day, and fermentation took approximately 4 weeks. The 71B batch finished at 1.080 (19.3°Bx), while the DV10 batch finished at 1.073 (17.7°Bx).
After aging the ciders for two years, I re-assessed both batches. The 71B batch turned out fruitier (estery), while the DV10 batch turned out more apply (neutral fermentation). After playing with blends, I settled on a straight 50/50 ratio, which yielded the best profile. The finishing gravity of the blended cider was approximately 1.077 (18.7°Bx) with 11% ABV. Ciders were clarified with Super-Kleer K.C. and blended before bottling. This cider can be bottle conditioned. The oldest commercial fire cider I’ve seen was 11 years old.",

FERMENTABLES
5 gal. (18.9 L) Heirloom Juice Blend: Gala, Wild, and Pink Lady Apples
0.5 gal. (1.9 L) Heirloom Juice Blend to be frozen and stored for future blending

1 tsp. (5 g) Fermaid K added at the beginning of fermentation
2.5 tsp. (12.5 g) pectic enzyme added at the beginning of fermentation

Original Gravity: 1.046 (11.5° P)
Final Gravity: 1.002 (0.5° P)

SRM: 3.5","Directions:
Clean all equipment and apples thoroughly before pressing and press directly into the sanitized primary fermentation vessel. Save 1/2 gal. (1.89 L) of juice and freeze it to use for blending to your desired sweetness level after the secondary maturation time. Pull 1 cup (237 mL) of juice, and dissolve both the Fermaid K and pectic enzyme in it before adding the solution back into the fermenter. Natural fermentation should take off after a couple of days, after which allow the cider to continue fermenting in the primary vessel for 2 months at 62°F (17°C). After two months, rack the cider into a secondary vessel. Purge the secondary vessel of oxygen before racking; a keg will work well for this purpose. Allow the cider to mature for an additional 5 months at 66°F (19°C) After the additional maturation time and carbonation, the resulting cider will be quite dry. Use a small syringe and the previously frozen apple juice to back sweeten to taste in sample glasses. This cider is semi-dry and uses roughly 11.5 oz. (340 mL) of fermented cider to 0.5 oz. (15 mL) of juice. Blend at packaging to your chosen ratio by adding the juice to a sanitized bottle, then filling the remaining volume with cider using a counter-pressure bottle filler. Force carbonate with CO2 to 1.8 vol. (3.6 g/L), which is pétillant. When all the bottles have been capped, heat pasteurize by heating a kettle of water to 180°F (82°C) and gently placing bottles in the kettle, making sure the water line is at or just below the fill level of the bottles. Turn off the heat, and let the bottles sit for 10 minutes before removing them and letting them return to room temperature. Repeat this process until all bottles are pasteurized, and then store in a cool location.",

Original Gravity: 1.091
Final Gravity: 1.007","Directions:
This is a blend of Michael’s high-gravity, high-acid New World cider featuring a high percentage of Golden Russet, Northern Spy, Liberty, McIntosh, and crabapples. It’s 9.5% ABV and off-dry, with Amy’s fantastic version of Ken Schramm’s Falls Bounty Cyser fermented dry from The Compleat Meadmaker. New England Cider needs an adjunct sugar character, and Fall’s Bounty happens to use just the sort the style needs. The last couple points of sugar to achieve medium sweetness were from back-sweetening with Michael’s Ice Cider. A small amount of medium toast American oak will add tannin, but don’t overdo it. The cider can be made in one recipe, but blending is a passion of both creators and an easy way to tweak things. The amount necessary of the cider and cyser blend will depend on the levels of sweetness fo the two components and strength of adjunct character. NEC shoudn’t show high amounts of honey. This can handle some age, as mild oxidation will just tend to emphasize the molasses and raisin. The indicated original gravity assumes you try to make this without blending to hit the 11% ABV mark. We like it served still at a cool room temperature. Primary Fermentation: Several months at around 50°F (10°C).",

Kevin shared the following:
Our winning beer is year one of a multi-year 15-gallon Solera Gueuze project brewed by myself and my son, Noah. The beer itself is a golden yellow, funky, mildly sour Belgian Lambic wheat beer with balanced notes of lemon and Brett on a bready malt base.
A traditional Gueuze is a beer made by blending one-, two-, and three-year-old barrel-aged Gueuze to make a final product. Due to space limitations at my home, we have chosen to brew our beer using the Solera technique where we age 15 gallons in a barrel for a year, remove 5 gallons and blend 5 fresh gallons into the barrel mix, and then age that for another year and repeat the process until we have our 3-year aged blend.","Ingredients:

Note: This recipe is intended to produce 10 gallons of beer. Noah brewed five more gallons at the same time, so there was a total of 15 gallons brewed (give or take) to split into three 5-gallon batches, each with a different yeast.
Single infusion mash at 152°F (66.7°C) for 60 minutes with ~36.84 quarts of water. Batch sparge with 8 gallons of water. Pre-Boil volume (approx.): 13.31 gallons (50.4 L)
Boil for 60 minutes, following the boil additions as listed in the ingredients. At the end of the boil, chill to fermentation temperatures as specified by the yeast packets (bug inoculations).
Separate the wort equally among three 5-gallon buckets. Pitch one yeast packet into each bucket (Wyeast 5526, 3278, and 5335). Ferment at room temperature for 14 days. We chose the kitchen to have the warmest spot in the house to develop the beer the way we wanted.
After the batches were fermented, we racked them into a used bourbon barrel that I had lying about that had already been souring on the last batch aged. There was no residual bourbon character in the barrel. The barrel sits in the lower level of my home which stays around 60-65°F (15.6-18.3°C) year-round.
After racking the 15 gallons (56.8 L) of Gueuze into the barrel, there was headspace in the barrel. We decided to let it ride to develop a pellicle for additional natural complexity… which it did.
We aged the barrel for an entire year before opening it to taste it. At around the one-year point, we brewed a new 5-gallon (18.9 L) batch of the base Gueuze and fermented it with one of the bug inoculations we previously used.
For the Solera project, we racked 5 gallons of the one-year aged beer from the barrel and racked the 5 gallons of fresh Gueuze in. After that ages for a year, we will have, theoretically, 10 gallons of 2-year aged Gueuze in the barrel blended with 5 gallons of one-year aged Gueuze. And, the project continues…
The 5 gallons of one-year aged Gueuze for 2023 was bottled with fresh yeast and corn sugar to create our entry for the competition.",

The Mivino Pinot Grigio juice concentrate in this recipe comes from a kit that yields 3 gal. (11.4 L) of wine when diluted 50:50 with water. The kit includes 1.5 gal. (5.7 L juice). This recipe uses half of that (0.75 gal., 2.8 L) for a 3 gal. (11.4 L) batch of beer.
Mash malt at 152°F (67°C) for 45 minutes using a thickness of 1.25 qt./lb. (2.6 L/kg), or about 8.13 qt. (7.7 L) of mash water. Vorlauf, lauter, and sparge with 7.12 qt. (6.7 L) sparge water. Pre-boil volume should be approximately 3 gal. (11.4 L).
Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Post-boil volume will be approximately 2.25 gal. (8.5 L). Chill to 65°F (18°C), then add the grape juice concentrate to bring total fermenter volume to 3 gal. (11.4 L).
Microwave 4 oz. (118 mL) bottled water for 15 seconds to warm it to 100°F (38°C), then add yeast and Go-Ferm. Allow 30 minutes to rehydrate and pitch to wort. Oxygenate at 2 liters/minute for 30 seconds. Ferment at 65°F (18°C) for 17 days then transfer to a Corny keg. Chill to 40°F (4°C) and force carbonate to 2.5 vol. (5 g/L) of CO2.",

American cream ale is a great beer style for those just getting their feet wet in tasting craft beer.
With faint malt notes and little to no hop aroma, it is similar to the ubiquitous American light lager. Like most ales, we'll ferment this between 65° F and 70° F for a crisp, light-bodied beer. Though cream ale is considered an ale by style guidelines, it is not uncommon to use lager yeast in brewing this style. This particular recipe is known to have a slightly more elevated hop flavor than traditional cream ales, with some fruitiness and sweet corn notes.
This recipe was created and brewed by Chris ""Pacman"" Ingermann of BrewRats homebrew club in Muncie, Ind. It took home a gold medal in the 2002 National Homebrew Competition.","Ingredients:
