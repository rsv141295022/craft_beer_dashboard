Early 20th-century recipes involve the addition of invert sugar or molasses. Add some if you want a really sweet beer.

What is a “SMaSH” beer recipe?
“SMaSH” stands for “single malt and single hop.” The acronym alludes to the simplistic listing of ingredients in a beer recipe, where only one type of malt and one type of hop are used.
There are many benefits to brewing a SMaSH beer recipe. With having a limited amount of ingredients, you can test your sensory skills to see how a specific hop or malt comes through in a recipe. By building an understanding of what to expect when using certain ingredients, you can make more informed decisions on what ingredients to incorporate in future recipes with more than one malt and/or hop.

This recipe comes courtesy of Mark Rocheleau and Andrew Orr. There are options for homebrewers who live in states where marijuana and/or industrial hemp is legal and want to combine their craft beer with marijuana or hemp for personal enjoyment. This tripel-style, THC infusion combines the golden strong ale mild spice with a pleasing THC tincture.
THC-infused beer can—and very likely will—induce psychoactive effects, which can vary from person to person. Consume these beers responsibly and at your own risk. If you are unsure of what to expect, start with a very small sample and wait a few hours before consuming more.
Editor’s Note: Despite legalization and/or decriminalization of cannabis and cannabis-derived products by many states and the District of Columbia, marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and, thus, federally illegal. The American Homebrewers Association neither endorses nor discourages brewing with cannabis-related products, however homebrewers who do so should remember that such beers are not permitted in the National Homebrew Competition.

Gooding used the brown-skinned variety of ube that’s purple inside. They were cut and roasted at 375°F (190°C) for 60 minutes and then slightly mashed (in the potato sense of the word) and rehydrated with boiling water so they would not absorb much liquid.

Spelt can be a bit hard to track down, but the unique, cracker-like graininess it imparts makes it worth the effort. If you can’t find spelt malt, health food stores often have bags of unmalted spelt available, but if you decide to use unmalted spelt, be prepared to conduct a cereal mash to ensure conversion.
You can make a mixed-culture version of this beer by racking half of the finished beer into a 3-gallon carboy and pitching a sachet of BBXMAD1 (The Mad Fermentationist Blend). Ensure that the beer is stable before packaging (this can take several months, and your mileage may vary). If you intend to make a dedicated solera, reference the instructions in the body of the article.","Ingredients:

Named for the city of Leuven—home of Europe’s longest bar counter—this Belgian-style wheat beer recipe explores the historic Leuven white ales that gained popularity in the 1700s. The traditional process of brewing Leuven’s white beer has been described as “hopelessly complicated,” so brewer and author Roel Mulder presents a modern take in his article The Lost White Beers of Belgium.
Expect this slightly-cloudy, pale-colored ale to have a prominent malt character with hints of spice from the yeast and hops. Weighing in just below 3% ABV, this makes for a great session beer.","Ingredients:

To do this the old-fashioned way, divide the grain bill into goedzakken and vetzakken grists. For the goedzakken, take 1.7 kg (3.75 lb.) of malt, 300 g (10.6 oz.) of wheat, and all the oats; the remainder will constitute the vetzakken. The idea is to conduct a fairly standard mash with the goedzakken grist. Then, place the first half of the runnings into the kettle and add the vetzakken grist. Leave this at 70–80°C (158–176°F) for 20 minutes and then boil for one hour. Keep stirring to avoid caramelization.
The remainder of the goedzakken wort is boiled separately with the hops for 1 hour. Filtering might be a problem, so use rice hulls or wheat husks as a filter aid. Another option is the traditional way: push in a basket (I used a plastic basket from a salad spinner), let the wort flow in, and just spoon it out.
Leave the wort to cool in a coolship or similar vessel for natural Lactobacillus inoculation. Combine the cooled goedzakken wort with the cooled wort obtained from the combined vetzakken and goedzakken boiled mash and pitch yeast. Drink fresh, within 3 or 4 weeks after primary fermentation.",
https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/gordon-strong-american-porter/,Not Found,"American porters have a stronger character than modern English porters (which is true for most American adaptations of traditional English styles). The challenge in making this style is to not have overly burnt flavors dominate, and not have the hops clash with the dark malts.
This version from Gordon Strong (featured in Modern Homebrew Recipes) uses roasted barley instead of black malt, and the hopping includes some orange and apricot flavors.
Sensory Description: Balanced roast with a bready base malt, slightly fruity fermentation character, and earthy hops. Moderately strong with a dry finish, malty and roast aftertaste, and balanced bitterness.
Formulation Notes: Fairly straightforward composition, featuring mostly English ingredients. The base malt and yeast are more neutral than an English version, which lets the specialty malts and hops be prominent. The hop flavor is higher on this version, with the first wort hops providing a woody, earthy note, while the later hops give more apricot and orange notes( which I think plays well with the chocolate and light coffee character). Strength and body are on the higher side. The dry hopping is optional, but I fresh hop character as an extra aroma dimension.","Ingredients:

If you really want to stand out as an American style, you can also use classic hops like Cascade and Centennial late. I normally use Cascade at knockout instead of the 5 minute addition and dry hop with Centennial. With fairly simple grist, this beer is also a good baseline for matching other beer flavors to source ingredients. Look for the deep caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors and adjust the quantities based on what you prefer. I would adjust each of those specialty grains no more than 50% up or down as you experiment. I think this beer is also good with a lower bitterness level (in the mid 20s). I tend to mash a couple degrees lower when making aversion with lower bitterness (like 151°F/66°C). I’ve also made a more session strength version of this, reducing everything proportionally to be a 4% ABV beer and omitting the dry hopping altogether. A stronger 7% version is also good; I sometimes make that version to age."

Mash at 148°F (64°C) for 75 minutes and sparge as usual to collect the full pre-boil volume. Bring wort to a boil, or at least to 180°F (82°C), just to sterilize. Chill wort to 110°F (43°C). Check pH and gravity, and add lactic acid, if needed, to reduce pH to 4.5 for safety.
Decant the Goodbelly juice and pitch the Lactobacillus sediment into the wort. Keep this wort around 90–100°F (32–38°C) for two days for souring to take place. After two days, measure pH and gravity. The gravity should not have changed much, but the pH should have fallen into the low 3s (ours fell to about 3.3). The soured wort should have a clean sour, grassy smell. If it smells like vomit, it’s been infected with something else and you may need to dump it.
Bring the soured wort to boil and add hops and spices at indicated times. Chill to 70°F (21°C), move to fermenter, and pitch US-05.
As fermentation wraps up, thaw and refreeze the mango two or three times to help break down the fruit cell walls. When fermentation is complete, add the thawed mango and let it sit in the fermenter for five days.

The mash program is quite complex and best reproduced as the timetable Olavi uses on the day.
6:00 a.m.: Mix grist with lukewarm water but not too much.
7:30 a.m.: Add slightly warmer water to the mash.12:00 p.m.: Add more hot water, this time bringing the mash to 58°C (136°F).
2:00 p.m.: Transfer mash to kettle and start heating it by fire, while stirring constantly.
2:50 p.m.: Stop heating when the surface of the mash is covered in foam and grains start rising to the surface in little spurts. The temperature at the center should be 80°C (176°F).
Originally, Olavi used juniper and straw as the filter bed support for the lauter tun but nowadays he uses only a fine steel mesh.
Transfer the hot mash to the lauter tun. Start running off and, as long as the wort is not clear, pour it back on top to be filtered again. Add hot liquid as necessary to get enough wort.
Cool the collected wort to 22°C (72°F), then pitch yeast together with the handful of hops. Ferment for 3 days. Ferment to the point where you can make a furrow through the foam on the fermenting beer and the furrow does not close again quickly.
Olavi also makes small beer by running off more wort after he’s lautered the main beer. For 25 liters (6.6 gal.) of main beer, you would get about 3 liters (3.2 qt.) of small beer."

Note: this recipe is intended to create a 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort, yielding 5 gallons (19 L) of beer. A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 8.5 quarts (8.1 L) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132°F (56°C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C). Hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm or stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, lager the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45°F (1.5 to 7°C) for 3 to 5 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

Grind unmalted wheat berries in malt mill until the consistency of grits; this takes approximately four passes through. If in need of aged hops, ask your local shop if they have any “expired” hops. They are also available through online retailers. In a pinch, bake in the oven spread out on parchment paper at 160°F (71°C) for 6 hours. Create yeast starter the day prior to brewing. Add 2 gallons (7.57 L) of water to milled wheat and bring to a boil to gelatinize the wheat. Boil 15 minutes while stirring constantly. Cool to 166°F (74°C) by adding approximately 2.5 cups (591 mL) cold water and stirring. Add 0.75 lb. (340 g) two-row and 0.75 lb. (340 g) six-row malt and add to mash tun. Let rest for 1 hour. Add remaining malt and rice hulls and 1.25 gallons (4.73 L) of 175°F (79°C) water and mash another hour. Sparge with enough 190°F (88°C) water to bring it to 7 gallons (26.5 L). This will help to avoid a stuck sparge, and husk tannin extraction is a minimal concern due to the use of the huskless berries. Additionally, any husk-derived compounds extracted from the malt will be consumed by Brettanomyces over the years. Add hops and boil to reduce volume to 5 gallons, approximately 1.5 to 2 hours depending on your equipment. This length of boil should eliminate any cheesy flavors from the aged hops. To maintain oxygen exposure, an actual barrel is preferred over a glass carboy, but oak spirals/chips can be used if necessary. Rack to barrel or carboy and ferment at 65°F (18°C). Age in barrel for up to three years. Tartness from the lambic cultures in the blend will develop by 18 months. Bottle using 5 ounces (140 g) of corn sugar to prime. Beer continues to improve in the bottle indefinitely.",

This recipe was provided courtesy of Roel Mulder. When in the 1990s the Bosteels brewery was developing a three-grain beer, they came upon a 17th century brewing record from the Discalced (“shoeless”) Carmelite monastery in the nearby town of Dendermonde. They used it as an inspiration for their now world-famous Tripel Karmeliet.
Here’s Roel's interpretation of the original recipe for the Carmelites’ “Good Beer” from approximately 1679–1689. The original monastery was closed in 1796 and subsequently demolished. It is now the site of a courthouse.","Ingredients:

The original brewing record is rather concise. It is “an instruction to brew 16 barrels of good beer,” for which were used 12 vats of wheat, 36 vats of barley, and 6 vats of spelt or “short oats,” along with 40 pounds of hops. There’s no indication of what was malted and wasn’t, but from common practice at the time it can be concluded that the barley was malted and the wheat was not. At Villers abbey, some of the spelt was malted and some wasn’t. I tried to make the best sense of the quantities indicated, and the result is actually comparable in gravity to that of today’s Tripel Karmeliet. My version is also a bit flattered in the sense of efficiency: probably at the time efficiency was lower and attenuation often wouldn’t go much higher than 50%.

Dough in at approximately 113°F (45°C) for a 30-minute hydration and beta-glucanase rest. To mitigate subsequent lautering problems, it is also advisable to add about 10% of the dry malt weight in rice hulls at dough-in. After the cytolytic rest, infuse the mash with hot brewing liquor to raise the temperature to 122°F (50°C) for a proteolytic rest of 30 minutes at the peak-performance temperature of protease. Next, raise the mash to 149°F (65°C), the peak-performance temperature of beta amylase. This ensures the production of plenty of fermentables, and thus of alcohol. Allow 30 minutes for this diastatic rest. Repeat the temperature rise a final time to reach the alpha amylase peak temperature of 162°F (72°C). Rest the mash again, this time for 15 minutes, to convert the remaining starches into unfermentable dextrins for extra body in the finished beer. The large grain bill, in conjunction with the many hot-water infusions, is also likely to fill the mash tun to the limit of its capacity. Recirculate the wort thoroughly for perhaps 30 minutes. Then sparge and lauter simultaneously. Use the hot sparge liquor to raise the grain bed temperature to the mash-out temperature of 170°F (77°C). The run-off is likely to be slow! Stop sparging as soon as the kettle gravity is about 1.086 (20.8°P), assuming a 10% evaporation rate during a 90-minute kettle boil. In some mash tun configurations, because of aspect ratios and false-bottom designs, a kettle gravity of 1.086 may not be possible to achieve. In this case, simply sparge until the kettle is full. Then extend the boil until the net kettle gravity of 24°P is reached through evaporation. When weighing out the hop additions, adjust quantities to the projected actual net kettle volume. Boil for at least 90 minutes (or longer if the original gravity at the start of the boil is an issue). Add bittering hops 60 minutes before the anticipated shutdown time. Add flavor hops with 10 minutes of boil time remaining. Add aroma hops 5 minutes before shutdown. Whirlpool and chill. Pitch about twice as much yeast as you normally would for a “regular” brew and aerate well. In our experimental batch, we used 1.5 oz./5 gal. (44 g/19 L) of dried yeast. Primary ferment the brew at the middle of the preferred temperature range of the selected yeast for a total of 3 weeks. At the end of primary fermentation, rack the brew into a clean tank for 7–8 days of secondary fermentation. Prime and bottle the brew. Alternatively, rack the brew into a keg and let it mature for 2 weeks under pressure. Finally, adjust carbonation in the keg to 3.3 to 4.5 volumes (6.6 to 9 g/L) of CO2 before dispensing it unfiltered from the keg.",

* Vanilla bean should be prepared in a tincture: split and scrape the bean(s), add to a small glass, and top with very small amount of vodka (enough to cover the scraped bean and filling).
* Add the vanilla bean tincture and coconut with the dry hops: I usually put them all together in a muslin bag.
* Once fermentation is complete, cold crash for 24 hours and then package.",

Dough in at 131° F with 1.5 qt/lb of pre-treated water (including sufficient lactic acid to bring mash pH to 5.2. I used 3.5 mL), rest for 15 minutes (I recirculate and regulate temperature with a HERMS system). Raise temperature to 148° F and rest 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 160° F and rest 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 168° F and rest 10 minutes. Fly sparge with 170° F water, with FWH addition in kettle as you run off. Boil 90 minutes, adding whirlfloc 15 minutes prior to knockout and yeast nutrient 10 minutes prior to knockout. Chill as cold as you can, as quickly as you can. Rack into a sanitized carboy, cover the neck with foil, and allow the cold break to settle. After 30 minutes or so, rack the clear wort off the trub into your fermenter. If it is not 50° F at this time, chill it to 50° F. Pitch yeast, then force pure oxygen into solution through a sintered stone for 2 minutes. The convection from the oxygen helps distribute the yeast into the beer. Allow the beer temperature to rise to 52° F and hold until gravity falls to ~1.030. Raise the beer temperature to 57° F and hold until gravity falls to ~1.016. Raise the beer temperature to 62° F and hold until fully attenuated and then start pulling samples and testing for VDK reduction. Once you get a negative VDK result, perform a closed transfer to a keg. Begin dropping the keg temperature a few degrees every 12 hours, with low CO2 pressure on the keg to prevent air ingress through the lid. Once the beer has reached 32 °F, fine with gelatin and lager for 4 weeks. Force carbonate to 2.7 volumes.",

An interpretation of the recipe given by Georges Lacambre in his reference work Traité complet de la fabrication des bières et de la distillation. I have replaced the 6 to 8 hours of boiling with an addition of some dark malt.
Little is known of the original yeast profile: the historical 60 to 63 percent attenuation seems poor to our eyes, but for its day, this beer was relatively well attenuated. A saison- or Brett-like profile seems appropriate, but to get that historical flavor, try to keep attenuation low by creating more unfermentable sugars in the mash. This helps simulate the fairly uncontrolled conditions that would have been found in a traditional Belgian brewery.","Ingredients:

Another option is the traditional way: push in a basket (I used the plastic basket from a salad spinner), let the wort flow in, and just spoon it out. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

Recipe by Terje Raftevold, adapted by Stan Hieronymus and the editors of Zymurgy
This version of raw ale is brewed north of the Jostedalen glacier in western Norway in the three traditional districts Sunnfjord, Nordfjord, and Sunnmøre. Terje Raftevold’s recipe is typical. The name literally means “grain beer,” making it clear how it differs from “beers” made from syrup, juniper berries, and so on. Historically, these beers were brewed from barley, although on the coast the poor would mix in oats when necessary. Today, most people use a mix of 50 percent pale malts and 50 percent Pilsner malts, but there are still a few brewers who make their own malts.
Raw ale wort is not boiled. Because the process has no hot side, brewers must sanitize every bit of equipment that will touch the wort, including the lauter tun. When brewing raw ale, it’s important to have a mash that’s long enough and/or hot enough to properly pasteurize the mash, since there is no boil. The hotter the mash, the shorter it can be, but it’s difficult to be precise about the exact relationship. Adding a hot sparge water infusion at the end of the mash also helps.
Kornøl is always made with a boiled juniper infusion and lautered through juniper. Norwegian farmers use Juniperus communis, which is common in Europe but not in North America. It can be found in Canada and a few places in the United States. The hops can be boiled with a little wort, or the hot wort can just run through the hop bag. In either case, the hop character should be very low and usually not detectable at all. Juniper, rather than hops, balances the flavor. In the glass, these beers look like hefeweizen with no head: yellow, hazy, and opaque with a small coarse head. The aromas are variable, but one should detect boiled juniper, raw ale aromas, strong straw and grain flavors from the malts, and tropical fruitiness from the kveik. The mouthfeel should be full, both from the sugar and from the protein from the raw ale, and also from the kveik yeast. It should also be somewhat mealy from the lack of filtration and the raw character. Carbonation should be low, like British cask ale.
Fermentation time should be two to three days, after which the beer is racked and then stored cool. Alcohol strength is usually 5.3% to 7.6% for the main beer, with final gravities from 1.013 to 1.024. Since the 1990s, quite a few local brewers have begun to boil the wort. Some will boil for an hour, but others boil only 10 to 15 minutes to sterilize the wort.","Ingredients:

Original Gravity: 1.075 (18.2°P)
Final Gravity: 1.018 (4.6°P)
ABV: 7.5% by volume
SRM: 5","Directions:
Use only the outermost tips on the juniper; don’t use thick branches. Put the juniper in the kettle and boil it for a little while. Take off the juniper infusion for the mashing and let it cool for a while. Mash in at an initial temperature of 165°F (74°C) and mash for at least an hour at 165°F (74°C). The lauter tun filter should be juniper branches. Run off the wort through a bag containing the hops, cool the wort, and transfer to the fermenter. Add hot juniper infusion as necessary. Ideally, lautering should be very slow—if not, you may want to extend the mash by an hour. Traditionally, one should start the yeast with the first wort (which is also the strongest) and then pitch the starter after a few hours. With a rapid, modern lauter this can be difficult, in which case creating a yeast starter from dried malt extract (DME) may be a good alternative. Cool the wort to 86°F (30°C) and pitch the yeast. Insulate the fermenter to assure a high fermentation temperature: 95°F (35°C) is just fine. Top harvest the yeast after 40 hours, and rack after 48 hours. Target an original gravity of 1.075 with a final gravity of 1.018 after 40 hours for a resulting 7.5% ABV. Cellar the beer cold to stop fermentation.",

May 1st is a bank holiday in Germany (Labor Day), and May is very often a transition month from the cold winter to a warmer spring in Bavaria. The same is true for a well-brewed Maibock, or heller bock. It is a real bock, i.e. a strong beer, but it is brewed with an eye to high drinkability. With its pale color, it is not as rich and malty as its darker brothers and sisters, which are typical for fall and winter in Bavaria. With high drinkability and an alcohol content of 6.3 to 7.4% ABV, heller bock can be quite a “dangerous” beer.","Ingredients:

Heat 21.5 qt. (20.3 L) water to 104°F (40°C) and mash in the 13.8 lb. (6.3 kg) grist. This should lower the temperature to about 100°F (38°C). Let the mash rest for 30 minutes. Take about one-third of the mash as the first decoction. Use Dickmaische, which is the part with grist that settles at the bottom of the mash tun, heat it to 151°F (66°C), and rest for 20 minutes. After the rest, heat the decoction further to 162°F (72°C) for a 15-minute rest before you bring the decoction to a boil. Don’t forget to stir while heating. After a 15-minute boil, reunite the decoction with the remaining mash. Again, don’t forget to stir to avoid local overheating and enzyme destruction. The mash should now have a temperature of around 151°F (66°C). Rest for 10 minutes. Again, remove one-third of the mash from the mash tun. This time use Dünnmaische, the part with less grist, which will collect in the upper portion of the mash tun. Heat the decoction to 162°F (72°C) while stirring. Rest for 10 minutes before you bring the decoction to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes and reunite the mash in the mash tun while stirring. The mash should now reach around 162°F (72°C). Rest for 15 minutes and check saccharification with an iodine test. Heat the mash to 172°F (78°C) and hold a mash-out rest for about 10 minutes before you start lautering. Sparge with 172°F (78°C) water until the wort is diluted to a gravity of around 1.057 (14°P) in the kettle. Heat up for a 90-minute boil. Add 0.7 oz. (20 g) Magnum 30 minutes after the wort starts to boil. Add 0.4 oz. (10 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh 75 minutes into the boil. Add the last 0.7 oz. (20 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh 5 minutes before you finish the 90-minutes boil. Your wort should now have a gravity of 1.068 (16.5°P). Cool wort to about 48°F (9°C) and pitch the yeast. Let the temperature rise to about 50°F (10°C) and wait until the beer reaches a gravity of about 1.018 (4.5°P), before you transfer it to a secondary fermenter. Let the beer ferment under a top pressure of 16 psi (1.1 bar) for another 2 weeks before you cool it to about 32°F (0°C). Allow the beer to mature for at least another 5 weeks. If you bottle condition your brew, pitch at 48°F (9°C) and let the temperature rise to 50°F (10°C). Wait until the gravity doesn’t change for at least 3 consecutive days before you transfer the beer to your filling bucket. Add sugar for a carbonation of 4.5 g/L (if you ferment at 50°F/10°C, this should be 4.5 g sugar per liter).","“Earl’sches” Variation
This beer can be also brewed using Earl’s decoction process.
Split the grist into a 9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) portion and a 4.3 lb. (2 kg) portion. Prepare two portions of water with 10.4 qt. (9.8 L) each.
Stir the 9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) grist into one of the 10.4 qt. (9.8 L) portions of water. Heat this mash to 149°F (65°C) and rest for 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 162°F (72°C) and rest for 30 minutes. Check for saccharification with an iodine test. When the mash is fully converted, bring it to a boil and boil for 20 minutes.
Add the second portion of the water to the mash. This should reduce the mash temperature to below 149°F (65°C). If not, add more cold water. Stir in the remaining 4.3 lb. (2 kg) grist. Heat the entire mash to 149°F (65°C) and rest for 30 minutes. After the rest, raise the mash temperature to 162°F (72°C) and rest for 30 minutes. When an iodine test shows full saccharification of the mash, heat to 172°F (78°C) and mash out. Begin lautering and follow the remaining instructions above."

From Mike L.: This is my standard sahti recipe, adapted for typical homebrewing equipment. I have refined it based on my tastes, various brewing experiments, and conversations with sahti masters. While not a classic family recipe, it’s a good example of homebrewed sahti today.
I brew this ale with the same gear I use for modern ales, and I have included options for ingredients easily found outside Finland. I have also streamlined the mashing procedure: with a heated mash tun, the brew day can be over in less than five hours. I haven’t included strict fermentation guidelines; this will depend on the yeast you use.","Ingredients:
MALTS
14 lb (7 kg) Pilsner or Vienna malt
4.8 lb (2.4 kg) Munich malt
1.2 lb (0.6 kg) Kaljamallas (Finnish dark rye malt) or caramel rye malt

0.4 oz (12 g) juniper branches or juniper berries

Yield: 5 US gallons (20 L)
Original Gravity: 1.097 (23°P)
Final Gravity: 1.034 (8.5°P)
ABV: 8%
SRM: 17","Directions:
Mash the malts at 140°F (60°C) for 45 minutes using 1.1 qt. water per pound of grain (2.3 L/kg). If using juniper, mix the branches or berries into the mash. Raise the temperature to 158°F (70°C), and hold 45 minutes, and then raise to 176°F (80°C) for the final 15 minutes. Recirculate until the wort runs clear. Sparge with 176 to 194°F (80 to 90°C) water to collect 5 gal. (20 L). If using an immersion chiller, sanitize it in the hot wort. Chill the wort to fermentation temperature. If using baker’s yeast, dissolve the fresh yeast in a small amount of cold water, or rehydrate dry yeast in 104°F (40°C) water. Pour wort into the fermenter, add yeast, let ferment, and keep at fermentation temperature until the yeast is finishing its work. Depending on the yeast and temperature, this usually takes 1 to 3 days. When the sahti still tastes sweetish but is no longer cloying, lower the fermentation temperature. If unsure about the timing of this transfer, you can check whether the gravity is in the range 1.034 to 1.038 (8.5 to 9.5°P). Cold condition the sahti for 7 to 10 days, and then rack to storage containers. The ale is ready immediately after racking. Store cool at all times.",

This beer was initially conceived as an attempt at one of my first and favorite craft-style ales from way back in the 1980s: Redback from Matilda Bay Brewing in Australia. I have fond memories of quaffing bottles of Redback during my undergraduate years at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. That beer did not contain sugar but was instead a down-under version of Bavarian wheat ale. My recipe is somewhat drier due to the cane sugar, but with high carbonation, low hopping, and Bavarian wheat yeast to add subtle hints of clove and banana, it is exceptionally refreshing.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4.5 lb (2.04 kg ) home-malted wheat
4.5 lb (2.04 kg) Briess two-row pale malt
12 oz (340 g) raw organic cane sugar (optional)
HOPS
2 oz (57 g) homegrown Sterling 2.3% a.a. @ 60 min
YEAST
White Labs WLP380 Hefeweizen IV Ale Yeast (2 L starter)
WATER
Soft: use 1 g/gal. CaCl2 added to reverse osmosis water
OTHER INGREDIENTS
6.5 oz (177 g) destrose to prime to 3.25 vol (6.5 g/L) CO2
Specifications:
Yield: 5.5 US gallons (20.8 L)
Original Gravity: 1.050 (12.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.007 (1.8°P)
ABV: 5.70%
IBU: 13
SRM: 3
Boil Time: 60 minutes
Efficiency: 75%","Directions:
Adjust your mill for the average kernel size of your home-malted wheat. My wheat kernels were quite a bit smaller than those of commercial malt, and my first brew with home-malted wheat got too coarse a crush—I got a great sparge but a lousy yield. With subsequent batches, not only did my level of modification improve, but double milling the wheat malt on the finest mill setting gave me much better results without any need for rice hulls. Mash grains for 20 minutes at 125°F (52°C). Raise to 140°F (60°C) and hold 30 minutes. Raise to 152°F (67°C) and hold 40 minutes. It’s probably a good idea to do a starch test to ensure conversion. When it passes, mash out at 168°F (76°C). Fly sparge with 168°F (76°C) water. Boil 60 minutes, adding homegrown hops one hour before flameout. Be sure to take an initial gravity reading. You may not need to add sugar, but if your initial is running low, add cane sugar to the boil as needed to compensate. I got a pre-boil gravity of 1.040 (10°P) and added 12 oz. (340 g) of cane sugar to bring the gravity up to 1.044 (11°P), which gave an original gravity of 1.050 (12°P) after boil losses. Keep in mind that my finishing gravity of 1.007 (1.75°P) is based on using the sugar addition; without sugar, expect an FG closer to 1.010 (2.5°P). Jar up priming gyle or speise 5 minutes before the end of the boil (if using). Chill wort to 64°F (18°C) and pitch a strong starter. Ferment for three days at 64°F (18°C) or until high kräusen, then allow the beer to free rise to 68°F (20°) and hold this temperature until fermentation is complete. Prime with gyle and bottle in sturdy glass bottles. Keep these at 70°F (21°C) for a week or until they begin to clear. Store at cellar temperatures for two weeks.","Extract Version
Not recommended. You will likely need the diastatic power of the full amount of domestic two-row for complete conversion."

(227 g) white sugar with 8 oz. (227 g) Simplicity Candi Syrup plus 6 oz. (170 g) table sugar. Prepare a 750 mL stir-plate starter of White Labs WLP500 Monastery Ale Yeast prior to brew day. Postpone the 30-minute Hallertau hop addition to 15 minutes before the end of the boil.
Conduct a single infusion mash at 149°F (65°C) for 75 minutes at a pH of 5.3, and fly sparge to collect 6.5 gal. (24.6 L) of wort. Add candi syrup and sugar to the hot wort for a pre-boil specific gravity of 1.036 (9°P). Boil 60 minutes, adding hops and spices (remember to add the Hallertau at 15 min. instead of 30 min.), to yield 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of 1.041 (10.2°P) wort.
Chill, oxygenate, and pitch at 64°F (17.8°C). Ferment at 71°F (21.7°C) for 2 days and then at 69–71°F (20.6–21.7°C) until fermentation slows. Raise to 72°F (22.2°C) for a couple of days until specific gravity reaches 1.004 (1°P). Rack to secondary and fine with 0.25 oz. (7 g) Polyclar mixed with 350 mL (12 fl. oz.) boiled water. Hold at 65°F (18.3°C) for one day, and then slowly lower temperature to 35°F (1.7°C) at a rate of about 4°F (2.2°C) per day.
Rack clear beer to a keg and hold at 35°F (1.7°C) under 15 psi (1,034 mbar) for 9–10 days or until carbonated to 3 vol. (6 g/L) CO2. If you can wait, let the beer cold condition for a month in the keg after racking and carbonating. The patient brewer will be richly rewarded with a smooth, bright beer."

If possible, conduct a stepped mash with 20 minute holds at the following temperatures:  122° F, 144° F, 156° F, and 168° F. Alternatively, you can do a single infusion mash for 60 minutes at 156° F and then sparge at 168° F. Continue with a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops and sugar according to the ingredients section. Start fermentation at 72° F, the let the temperature free rise. Don’t panic if temperatures get over 90° F! Biere de Garde yeast can be finicky sometimes and just quit fermenting if you try to cool the temperature. Once fermentation is complete, transfer to secondary. For best results, age your beer in or on red wine oak barrels or oak chips. The touch of red wine character gives the beer a lovely, subtle character that works well with the yeast and hop characteristics. Allow beer to age for at least 8 weeks, perhaps up to 12 weeks, bringing the temperature down to 45-50° F for the last 2-3 weeks. After aging, simply continue with bottling/kegging as usual. Brewer’s note: this beer requires patience and attention to temperature! Sure, let the fermentation temperature go as high as it wants, but then follow the aging program above for the best results. Biere de Garde is a funny yeast to work with, but its results can be beautiful. In fact, this is the perfect beer to brew in December, bottle in February, and drink in March. Cheers!",

Produced with a cultured abbey ale yeast, this beer also benefits from a mixed fermentation of a house wild culture, most likely including Brettanomyces and various Lactobacillus strains. Using the bottle dregs from a Bam Biére to inspire a secondary fermentation in a small oak barrel is probably the best way to recreate this beer at home. The other option is to purchase a mixed culture packet and some oak cubes or spirals and add to the secondary carboy after primary fermentation. Mash 147-149° F (64-65° C). Free rise temperature to 80° F (27° C) and above, do not control temperature during fermentation. Step down to 50-55° F (10-13° C) once fermentation is complete. Bottle condition to high carb levels. Heavy glass bottles must be used, such as a champagne bottle, to protect from explosion. The safer option is to keg the beer in a corny keg. To dispense the beer properly, higher amounts of C02 will be needed to drwa the beer out to limit excessive foaming.",

Crush the base malts as you normally would. If you are using the black malt, mill it separately and finely. The small amount of black malt can improve clarity at the expense of a bit of extra color (around 1 SRM). The flaked adjuncts do not need to be milled. Mix grains and adjuncts and mash in at 150°F (66°C) with 13.5 qt. (12.8 L) of water. Stir the mash every 5 minutes or so if it is possible to do so without losing heat. Take periodic iodine tests and mash out when you receive a negative result. Recirculate the wort until it runs clear or you have recirculated more than 10 qt. (about 10 L). Run off and sparge with water hot enough to maintain a grain bed temperature of 165–168°F (74–75°C). As you run off, do not let the pH of the runoff exceed 5.8. (You may need to collect less than 6 gal./23 L.) Add water, if needed, to the kettle to yield enough wort to achieve 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding bittering (Mosaic) hops for the final 60 minutes of the boil. Add the Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil. After knockout, add whirlpool hops and let steep for 10 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill the wort and transfer it to your fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast from yeast starter. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). When fermentation is winding down, at around 5–6°P (1.020–1.024), add the enzyme. When terminal gravity is reached, rack beer to secondary fermenter containing the dry hops in a mesh bag. Dry hop for 7–10 days, and then prepare a PVPP solution by dissolving the powder in as small an amount of water as you can manage: a couple of ounces (about 60 mL) should be plenty. Remove the dry hops and swirl the beer gently. Without splashing, stir the PVPP gently into the top layer of beer and re-affix the fermentation lock. Let the beer sit for at least 6 hours or overnight before racking to a keg or bottling bucket. Carbonate to around 3 volumes (6 g/L) of CO2. If you bottle condition and fermented at 68°F (20°C), use 6.3 oz. (170 g) of corn sugar to prime the bottles.",

Learn about Charlie Papazian's endeavor in brewing this recipe with hops grown at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.
by Charlie Papazian
After 48 years of brewing, I still enjoy explorations and recreations with homebrewing. I often tell a story about the beers of the first Great American Beer Festival in 1982, which featured 22 breweries pouring 40 beers for 750 attendees. The “microbreweries” that attended that very first year were Boulder Brewing, Sierra Nevada Brewing, River City Brewing, and Anchor Brewing.
The two beers that seem to be the most memorable were brewed by the then Falstaff Brewing Company: Ballantine India Pale Ale and Narragansett Porter. Both were distinguished by brilliant Cascade dry hopping. Both had a perfect foundation of malt character that elevated what I would call “old-school” Cascade hop flavor and aroma.
For those of you who weren’t around in those early days of Cascade hop cultivation, the Cascade hop of today is very different in character than the original cultivars we welcomed as Cascade hops in the early 1980s. A bright conflagration of citrus and pine is one way I recall experiencing it. My homegrown hops cultivated from those original cuttings still maintain those old-school characters.
The interesting thing about the Narragansett Porter is that it was once a regional brand of New England. The brewery faltered and the brand was bought by Falstaff and briefly resurrected for regionally reminiscent beer drinkers. But the version of Narragansett Porter presented at the 1982 Great American Beer Festival was different than the traditional brew of previous brewers and years.
I reviewed the 1982 Great American Beer Festival program (which I still have) and discovered some interesting information about that 1982 beer. The beer that was originally going to be sent and presented at the Great American Beer Festival was something called Ballantine Porter, and that’s what they sent us program information for. When the beers arrived, we discovered that the brewery had changed the name to Narragansett Porter and festgoers were the beneficiaries. It was a dark, medium-bodied porter with a balanced roasted, toasted dark malt flavor. The lightness of corn and a medium malt body accented the flavor and aroma experience of dry-hopped Cascade perfectly.
America’s First Dry-Hopped Beer
According to the program, which was the information given to us by the brewery, “This dark brew uses malted barley, a small amount of corn grits, top fermenting yeast and a blend of Cascade and Bullion hops. Ballantine [actually presented as Narragansett] Porter is dry hopped in storage during transfer from primary to secondary. CO2 is used to reinvigorate the hops later. … The peak for this brew is around 45 days. The alcohol content is over 6% by volume.”
It struck me that this may have been the first modern-day American-brewed beer that was dry hopped. The few existing microbrewers such as Sierra Nevada, Boulder Beer, River City, and Anchor Brewing were more likely late hopping during the brewing stage. I don’t recall that dry hopping in the fermentation/aging tanks had made its way into the process with American microbrewers yet.
I vividly recall that ʼGansett was delicious, and it has become the kind of beer I really enjoy these days. I wanted to recreate it, so I formulated Flubadub ‘Gansett Porter to replicate what I experienced in 1982. It was after I had formulated my recipe that I came across the above description, and to my delight, my recollection jived with the brewery’s description with one exception. My beer is a bit lower in alcohol content, which is where I am at these days.
Bullion hops are very difficult to get, so I substituted German Hallertauer. Their low bitterness and earthy flavors are easy to navigate. You’ll notice I add a touch of homegrown wild Colorado hops. These hops have a sulfur-like onion character and hardly any bitterness value; their IBU contribution to this recipe is only about 3 BUs. My feeling is that a blend of wild hops and Hallertauer can somewhat replicate Bullion’s character.
So, let’s cut the shuck and jive and get on with the recipe.

1 oz. (28 g) homegrown Cascade, 5% a.a. @ 0 min (5 HBU/140 MBU)
1.25 oz. (35 g) homegrown hops, blended into a powder, dry hop
YEAST
German or Bavarian type lager yeast. Yes, lager yeast. I use my own 35-year old-yeast, which is sold by White Labs as WLP862 Cry Havoc.

Efficiency: 76%","Directions:
A step infusion mash and separate cereal mash are employed to mash the grains. Add 6 qt. (4.3 L) of cold water to 1 cup (250 mL) crushed Pilsner malt and 1 pound (454 g) of flaked corn and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, add 9 qt. (8.6 L) of 140° F (60°° C) water to the remaining crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. After half an hour, add the boiling corn and Pilsner malt to the main mash. Add heat if needed to bring mash temperature up to 155° F (68° C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat, add the 0-minute hops, and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gal. (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop powder for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Partial-Mash Version

To prevent the impression of the beer being “”watered down”” you need to be careful not to collect too much wort through sparging since it’s not boiled for any length of time. No boil. Heat wort until it just starts to boil then turn off heat and chill to ambient temperature. Transfer to a sterilized carboy, aerate and pitch the yeast and bugs. Allow primary fermentation to reach completion and then transfer to a secondary vessel containing the cherry juice (note: the cherry juice adds a half gallon of liquid to the fermented brew and will also impact mouthfeel, tartness and alcohol in the end). Allow enough time in secondary so that any restart in fermentation from the cherry juice subsides. Allow beer temperature to raise and lower as it sees fit. Ambient temperature in cellar was around 65° F. Bottle once all signs of fermentation ceased. Carbonated to approx. 2.5 vol of CO2 with corn sugar (approx. 4oz).",

Yeast notes: Starter created from yeast dregs of several bottles of spontaneously fermented Belgian wild ales and pitched into this 5 gallons batch when approximately 1 quart of yeast cake starter had propagated. Alternative approximation to this methodology would be use of one package commercially available yeast to create approximately a 1 quarter starter. Suggest use of WLP655 White Labs Belgian Sour 1 mix of Omega Yeast OY-212 Brett Blend #3 Bring On Da Funk would be an appropriate method. Mash at 155° F for 1 hour, vorlauf for approximately 5-10 minutes (until wort runs clear). Ensure first wort hops added to boil kettle during wort collection process. Boil for 60 minutes, add hops, whirlfloc tablet and yeast nutrient per schedule. Chill to approximately 75° F after boil and fermented at approximately 65° F for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, add raspberry puree. Sugars in the puree will cause fermentation to restart. Allow beer to age on raspberry puree in fermentater for approximately 1.5 years, rack to secondary and bottle with corn sugar to approximately 2.8 volumes of CO2. Due to the use of commercial beer yeast dregs propagated in a starter, significant time was allotted to allow this beer to develop a complex fermentation profile. If commercially available yeast is used in lieu of creating a starter from bottle dregs, it is likely that 1.5 years may not be needed to develop a complex fermentation profile, suggest a period of 6 months could be used instead. If a shorter time period is used, check gravity before deciding to bottle to ensure all residual sugar from raspberry puree has fermented out.",

Whirlpool with flameout hops for 20 minutes, and then cool. Oxygenate and pitch an adequate amount of yeast (a starter or multiple packages of yeast) according to mrmalty. com. Don’t significantly overpitch. Ferment at 67°F (19°C). After a successful forced diacetyl test, cool the beer to 53°F (12°C) for two days. Dump the yeast and trub, if fermenting in a conical, then add the dry hops, back-flushing with CO2 or bubbling CO2 through the fermenter while adding the hops, if possible. Let the fermenter rise to 67°F (19°C) again during the dry hop. The large dry hop amount will likely add another few points of attenuation. After six days, cool the fermenter to 40° F (4° C) for two days, again dumping hops and remaining yeast, if possible. Fine with 15 mL of BioFine, agitating the beer with CO2 to mix it in thoroughly. Allow the beer to settle and clarify for two days before transferring it to a keg. Try to avoid introducing oxygen into the finished beer as much as possible (e.g. flush transfer lines with CO2 immediately before the transfer, completely seal the fermenter or keep slight positive pressure on the fermenter during the cold crash and perform a closed transfer to the keg).",

This beer was made with a reiterated mash in which wort from the first mash was used as brewing liquor for the second mash. The Maris Otter and half of the specialty grains (except the C20) were first mashed at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes, which was followed by a batch sparge to achieve a total wort volume of 11.37 gal. (43 L). After that, 5.4 gal. 20.4 L) of this wort was heated to 164°F (73°C) and used to mash the remaining grains for a second mash to hit 150° F (66° C) for 60 minutes. The remaining first runnings were heated and used to batch sparge the second mash. The reiterated mash allows you to hit a higher OG when the mash tun size is a limiting factor. It is also said to help enhance the malt flavors. Boil for 120 minutes. Chill to 65°F (18°C). Oxygenate 120 seconds with pure oxygen at 0.5 L/min. Let free rise and ferment at 68°F (20°C) for three days. Then let rise slowly to 71°F (22°C) over two days. Hold for 15 more days. Crash chill to 37°F (3°C) over two days. Keg carbonate to 12 PSI while keeping at 37°F (3°C) for 8 days. The beer was then aged in a cellar environment with slow seasonal fluctuations (mid-40s to mid-60s°F or 7–18°C) for 200 days, bottled, and then kept at 37° F (3° C).",

Measure gravity, adjust volumes for gravity vs. evaporation rate/boil length if needed to hit target OG of 1.050 and begin boil. It’s very important that you chill immediately and quickly because this is a hop-bursted beer. Delays will cause the beer to be too bitter. Chill to 64°F (18°C), oxygenate and pitch. Fermentation should start low and finish high: let primary free-rise gradually over the course of two weeks, bumping with heat, if needed later in the fermentation, to finish at 78° F (26°C) at the very end. Let sit in primary at 78°F (26°C) for a few days and keg, then chill and carbonate to taste (high level for wit). Ready to drink as soon as it is carbonated. Do not add more coriander or orange peel to the recipe. Let the Amarillo do the heavy orange lifting. Watch your base malt’s diastatic power, too.

In the early days of lager brewing outside its traditional central European home, several regional Bavarian styles were imitated abroad. One of these was Kulmbacher.
Even Heineken used to brew this style of strong, hoppy, very dark lager. But for some reason it quickly fell out of fashion and is today virtually unknown as a style. Which is a shame as I’m sure its bold flavors would go down well with modern drinkers. You could think of it as a Münchener on steroids.

This Bavarian method of decoction is taken from from Handbuch der Chemischen Technologie: Die Bierbrauerei by Dr. Fr. Jul. Otto, published in 1865, page 128. As soon as the water in the kettle reaches 50º C, as much as is needed is put into the mash tun to dough in. After an hour, when the rest of the water has come to the boil in the kettle, this is added to the mash. The temperature of the mash should be 53.75–56.25º C [128.75–133.25° F]. A small amount of water should remain in the kettle so that the temperature of the mash is correct. Or a small amount of cold water is added to the mash. When, after resting, the wort in the mash tun has cleared, this is run off and boiled in the kettle. After just a few minutes boiling, this lauter mash is added back to the tun and mashed for 45 minutes. The temperature of the mash should be 71.25–72.5º C [160.25–162.5º F]. Usually a small quantity of wort is left in the kettle and boiled with all the hops for 10 to 12 minutes (Hopfenrösten). The mash in the tun is left to rest for 90 minutes, then it is drawn off and added to the kettle where it interrupts the Rösten. The wort from the first lot of cold water poured over the grains is usually used for topping up the kettle. Boil wort 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Chill wort to 48° F (9° C) and pitch yeast.",

The main difference of Augsburger beer lies in the process of how it was made: instead of following the typical Bavarian decoction mash, historic sources describe a unique method that was only practiced in this form in Augsburg.
In addition to the different approach to mashing, the beer was also treated differently when filled into casks: as in other parts of Bavaria, the wooden casks in Augsburg were pitched. But while in other regions the pitch was allowed to cool down, in Augsburg the beer was filled into the casks when the pitch is still burning hot. This was said to give the beer of Augsburg its peculiar flavor that distinguished it from the rest of Bavaria.

The souring range of 113–115° F (45–46° C) should focus the souring efforts on native bacteria that give a cleaner sourness with some esters and a bright finish. The higher finishing gravity is crucial to help balance the higher levels of sourness and bitterness, as drying out the beer too much will yield a harsher finish. This beer uses two ale strains to yield a slightly elevated final gravity with some estery English character. The balance between final gravity, IBUs, and titratable acidity can help balance your sour beer’s “perceived sourness.”

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/the-charlie/,Not Found,"Ask any professional brewer how they got started and chances are they’ll mention a homebrew kit.
Kevin Ryan had just that sort of beginning when his fiancée Meredith gifted him a beermaking kit for Valentine’s Day. That kit was the seed that would eventually flourish into Service Brewing Company in Savannah, Georgia. Today, Kevin and Meredith brew and serve craft beer to thirsty patrons while also raising awareness and support for our nation’s veterans and first responders, a cause very important to Kevin who is a West Point graduate and former Army commander.
To celebrate their homebrew roots during American Craft Beer Week 2018, the Service Brewing crew decided to brew a beer in honor of the man who helped guide Kevin down the path of beer making: our own Charlie Papazian! Charlie’s book The Complete Joy of Homebrewing was one of the first brewing books Kevin cracked into, and it kick-started his journey into the world of professional brewing.
The recipe, aptly named “The Charlie,” is a citrus pale ale (CPA… Charlie Papazian… get it?) with a hefty dose of hops and an addition of pink guava. This hop-forward ale will satiate even the hoppiest of hop-heads, and the pink guava puree adds a little extra somethin’-somethin’ to keep your palate excited. And, of course, this recipe includes a hefty helping of relaxation, since Charlie would have it no other way!
Service Brewing Company will tap and pour The Charlie during American Craft Beer Week 2018 (May 14–20, 2018). Find out more about American Craft Beer Week on CraftBeer.com.
Independent Craft Brewery
Service Brewing Company is a small and independent craft brewery.
More than 6,000 operating breweries exist in the U.S., and 98 percent are considered small and independent. Service Brewing Company is one of these small and independent craft breweries.
When you’re shopping for beer, look for the independent craft brewer seal. You’ll spot it in a variety of places, including on packaging and labels, at events, on tap handles, menus and websites. This seal signifies a brewery as being small and independent.

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/13th-day-imperial-stout/,Not Found,"With a little over a year of brewing under her belt, Canadian homebrewer Chelsea Tessier came out on top in the 2018 Roxy Memorial Iron Brewer competition for her 13th Day Imperial Stout recipe. ""I was on my thirteenth day of 18-hour shifts, and I was exhausted,"" Tessier laughed when asked about the curious name.
The competition is held annually by the Edmonton Homebrewers Guild (EHG) and is named in honor of late EHG member Roxy Hastings. Hastings was known for homebrewing “imperial” versions of just about every style, so the competition fittingly focuses on high-gravity homebrew.
Despite being new to the scene, Tessier has dived into homebrewing headfirst, racking up multiple medals in BJCP-sanctioned competitions, and even remodeling her kitchen to fit her homebrew needs. Shortly after being bitten by the pesky “homebrew bug,” Tessier began modifying her kitchen to make it more conducive to brewing. First it was replacing the microwave with a hood fan. Then it was resurfacing the counter tops that became battle-scarred from brew days.
It culminated with a brand new stove, after the old one took a beating. “All in the name of brewing,” Tessier shares.
By day, Tessier is a microbiologist working for an environmental company performing exotoxicology work (testing live aquatic organisms for toxicity in effluent samples). This background in science fuels a lot of Tessier's interests in mastering the art of making beer at home. “There are infinite amounts of knowledge to be learned and put into practice, so I never find myself getting disinterested in homebrewing,” she shares.

Mash at 68° C (154° F) for 60 minutes. Note on Chelsea’s process: Chelsea does a single infusion, no-sparge mash with a brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) setup. For this recipe, she started with 32 L of water to end up with a 24 L batch. 4.3 g of baking soda was added to increase the pH of the mash since the large amount of roasted barley drives down the pH. The water in Edmonton is relatively hard, so no other adjustments were needed. A week-old yeast cake from a previous batch of homebrew was used. Future Variations: Chelsea plans to brew a variation of her 13th Day Imperial Stout recipe with more aroma and bittering hops and an English variety of yeast like Whitbread.",

In 2009, Drew Beechum, along with some of his fellow members of the Maltose Falcons, got together to compete amongst themselves to create ""something wild"" in memory of a friend who experimented with home-smoked malts. Thirty Falcons took Beanie's malt and promised to make something interesting. Drew's recipe was fueled by Thanksgiving dessert with hopes of imitating the taste of a dark, nutty, caramel flavor with a hint of smoke. The Southern Highlander sees about 3 hours of boil time, making it rich and full-bodied. This wee heavy certainly mimics a pecan pie's brown sugar syrup with the dose of maple syrup during secondary fermentation.

Rice is sometimes considered a cheap filler ingredient only suitable for American adjunct macro beers and the Japanese lagers found at your neighborhood sushi haunt. But historical precedent, at home and abroad, and modern recipes crafted with rice are proving that the adjunct can be a valuable ingredient in a variety of styles–—its contribution to light lager doesn't necessarily have to be the result of large-scale economics.
Rice can hold its own as a valuable addition to a number of beer styles. Rice obviously isn't a traditional ingredient in a Belgian tripel, but sugar adjuncts are. If you think of rice as light sugar adjunct, it makes sense in a tripel and creates a unique take on the style.","Ingredients:

Day 1: Prepare yogurt starter (multiple slower lacto strains) 2 days before brew day. Make 2 liters of 1.020 starter wort, cool to 100°F (38°C) and drop in 2 tablespoons Nancy’s plain nonfat Greek yogurt. Add a pinch os yeast nutrient and 0.5 teaspoon lactic acid to lower pH closer to mid 4s. Use an airlock and stopper. Swirl gently a couple of times a day. Keep culture on a heating pad to maintain about 100°F (38°C) for 2-3 days. Day 3: Mash in at 154°F (68°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Run 7 gallons (26.5 L) into the kettle and boil wort for 5 minutes to pasteurize, turn off heat and chill to 100°F (38°C). Add the yogurt starter to the kettle, 16 oz (473 mL) of mango Goodbelly probiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum), 0.5 tsp yeast nutrient, and 1 tsp lactic acid. Stir, purge air space above inoculate wort with CO2, and seal up the top of the kettle to prevent air ingress. Keep the kettle at around 95°F (35°C) for 3 days. Day 7: Boil soured wort for 60 minutes. pH should be 3.4, and wort gravity should increase from 1.038 to 1.044. Chill to 75°F (24°C) and rack to fermenter with 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient and saison yeast blend starter. Oxygenate 30 seconds. Fit fermenter with an airlock. Maintain fermenter in the mid 70s°F (23-24°C) for the first day, and then warm the fermenter up to about 90°F (32°C) on the second day. Around the third or fourth day of fermentation, just after high krausen, add 1 lb (0.45 kg) table sugar dissolved in a small amount of boiled water to re-ignite the yeast and boost the gravity. Original gravity with sugar addition should be 1.052. After 7 days of fermenting, rack to secondary on top of 10 lb (4.54 kg) of boiled, cooled raspberries. After an additional 7 days of fermentation, transfer to the serving keg, and force carbonate to 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) CO2. Water: Seattle tap water with 1 tsp gypsum and 1 tsp calcium chloride.",

There are loads of things to think about when you're talking beer and food flavor dynamics, and Charlie Papazian is someone we certainly trust when it comes to identifying beer styles that cut and complement different foods. In his World of Worts column in Zymurgy a few years ago, he highlighted some important points about beer flavor that will inform your food pairing choices. Things to pay attention to when you're building your menu, just to name a few, are acidity, carbonation, the level of roasted character, and bitterness.
Charlie presented this recipe for his Vitoria Vienna Pils, describing it as a beer that reflects the flavors, aromas, and nuanced complexity of even the simplest of recipes. This unfiltered, naturally conditioned German-style Pilsner is a hop flavor- and hop aroma-enhanced lager with subtle toast malt character that will elevate any food accompaniment.

It's probably safe to say that most homebrewers would be more than honored to have their recipes poured on commercial taps, and some have been lucky enough to have that opportunity. With the Great American Beer Festival Pro-Am Competition, you don't have to trade your day job for rubber boots and a malt shovel. It celebrates the bonds between America's professional and amateur craft brewers by judging commercially produced beers scaled up from award-winning AHA member homebrew recipes. This Argentine Strong Scotch Ale was originally created by Ron Yabut and was brewed by Elysian Brewing Co. in the 2007 GABF Pro-Am competition. It presents a toasty, sweet malt nose; has a medium-full body; and is malty-sweet in flavor with some pleasant fruity esters.

After hopping from brewery to brewery in Singapore in 2009, Charlie Papazian got inspired to make this damn good oatmeal stout based on his experience at Brewerkz Riverside Point. Charlie assures that any beer lover should make this spot a destination as soon as they hit the ground in Singapore. This version (created by Charlie himself) has a smooth, velvety texture and a creamy brown head. When you put this one up to your nose, you'll get a light cocoa and coffee flavor with subtle enhancement of aroma hops. Just over 4% alcohol by volume, this beer is truly for all seasons and surprisingly refreshing, even in the warmth of summer.

Charlie Papazian has done his fair share of reminiscing about his beer adventures, and—we must admit—they never get old. This recipe comes from an article he wrote in response to a request for more content on sessionable beers.

Spectacularly fresh and relatively low in alcohol, the beer inspired Papazian to produce his own wonderfully complex 4% ABV ale bursting with hop flavor and malt personality. This beer is refreshing, moderately floral, and spicy, with notable malt character that makes having more than one just too easy.

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 11 qt. (10.5 L) of 140° F (60° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 0 minutes remain (when boiling is done), add the 0-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gal. (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week.
Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

We recommend mashing in the grain to a starch conversion temperature of 156° F or higher. This strategy will help to achieve the body and mouthfeel we aim for. Another important element is our 75-minute boil, which may lead to excess color and flavor development if you are working over a very strong, direct flame. After your wort has cooled to 55° F degrees, you’re ready to pitch your favorite lager yeast! About 10 days prior to bottling or kegging, add the dry hops.",

Efficiency: 83%","Directions:
This recipe has been scaled to assume an 83% efficiency (right about what we used to get on our homebrew setup back in the day) and a 2 gal/hour boil off rate.  Please adjust the 2-row base malt according to your setup. Mash at 152° F (66.67° C) for 30-45 minutes (until conversion is complete), target mash pH 5.3. Sparge with 170° F water and collect at least 8.05 gallons (30.47 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil and add kettle hops per the indicated schedule. At knockout, use a large spoon or stirrer and create a whirlpool to cool the wort for a few minutes. The closer you can get to 190° F the better, but anything under 200° F will work. Add the whirlpool hops and let rest 10 minutes, then whirlpool again for a few minutes to create a nice compact trub/hop pile. After the whirlpool period, chill the wort to 68° F, oxygenate, and collect at least 5.05 (19.11 L) gallons of wort. Depending on your efficiency and setup, you can feel free to collect some extra wort to compensate for losses due to dry hopping. When the fermentation is about 1P from FG, add the dry hops. After 3-7 days after FG, crash and rack off of the hops. Carbonate to 2.55 volumes CO2.","Target Water Profile
Use Gypsum and Calcium Chloride to adjust to:
115-125 ppm Calcium
65-75 ppm Chloride
145-155ppm Sulfate
Finished SO4/Cl ratio: 2.3-2.5
Use Lactic Acid (88% strength) to adjust water pH, we use a .55 mL/gal rate, and we adjust both the mash water and sparge water separately (based on the volume of each).  If you do not have the capability to adjust mash and sparge water separately, you may make all of the mineral/acid additions based on your mash water volume. Always use de-chlorinated water."

If bottling, you may want to use a secondary fermenter to reduce the chance of clogging the bottle filler.",

6 10–12 in. (25–30 cm) boughs/branches of juniper for brewing water (the ones I used were laden with green berries). Juniper is not cedar. The needles on these branches were very thorn-like and difficult to handle without gloves.
4 10–12 in. (25–30 cm) boughs/branches of juniper for base water and lautering
1/4 tsp. (1 g) powdered Irish moss
3/4 cup (175 mL) corn sugar (priming bottles) or 0.33 cups (80 mL) corn sugar for kegging

Boil four boughs of juniper branches in 6.5 gal. (25 L) of water for one hour. After removing the spent branches, use the water for mashing and sparging. A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 8 qt. (7.6 L) of 140° F (60° C) “juniper water” to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 qt. (3.8 L) of boiling juniper water, heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), hold for about 30 minutes, and raise temperature to 167° F (75° C). Place 2 branches of juniper on the bottom of the lauter vessel and lauter and sparge with 3.5 gal. (13.5 L) of 170° F (77° C) juniper water. Collect about 5.5 gal. (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 15 minutes remain, add the 15-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Then strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gal. (18.9 L) with additional cold juniper water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Dissolve the compressed yeast in a small amount of boiled and cooled water. Use a jar and a teaspoon previously sterilized in boiling water to contain and mix the yeast and water. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 65° F (18° C). Ferment at about 65° F (18° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary, and if you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete. Relax. Don’t worry.

Recipe courtesy Marie-Annick Scott, Edmonton Homebrewers Guild
ALES Open Homebrewer of the Year Marie-Annick Scott shares one of her six award-winning recipes from the 2017 ALES Open—Canada’s largest homebrew competition—which was held April 17 to 22 in Regina, SK.
“I made this because one of my brothers can’t drink craft beers,” says Marie-Annick. “It’s a lot more work than most homebrewers would be willing to put in for what you get.”
This recipe is brewed using a process similar to that used by large breweries. You’ll brew a strong lager of 8% ABV, which is diluted to 4% ABV at packaging. This dilution process “minimizes the yeast flavors that you would get from fermenting the full batch volume and will give you that sought-after ‘flavorlessness,’” Marie-Annick notes. A long, multi-step mash program produces the highly fermentable wort necessary to accurately brew this style.","Ingredients:
MALTS
8 lb. 6-row malted barley
6.8 lb. rice flakes
HOPS
0.5 oz. (14 g) Willamette, 5.5% a.a. @ 60 min
0.13 oz. (4 g) Cascade, 5.5% a.a. @ 60 min
YEAST
Wyeast 2035 American Lager
WATER
Carbon filter water and perform a Munich decarbonation
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
1 Whirlfloc tablet @ 15 min
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrient @ 15 min
Bentonite and Polyclar for fining post-fermentation
Specifications:
Yield: 11 US gallons (41.6 L) after dilution
Original Gravity: 1.070 (16.9° P) before dilution
Final Gravity: 1.011 (2.6° P) before dilution
ABV: 4%
IBU: 6
SRM: 2","Directions:
Note: This batch is brewed as 5.5 US gallons (20.8 L) and then diluted to 11 US gallons (41.6 L). Mash in at 100° F (38° C) and hold 20 minutes for an acid rest. Raise mash temperature to 122° F (50° C) and hold for a 30-minute protein rest. Separate mash into thick and thin parts. Raise the temperature of the thick mash to 156° F (69° C), hold for 15 minutes, and then add back to the thin mash. This gives the alpha amylase enzymes a chance to break down the starches without denaturing the beta amylase enzymes in the thin mash. Raise the temperature of the recombined mash to 146° F (63° C) and hold for 2 hours. Mash out and sparge with enough water to achieve a pre-boil gravity of 1.060. Boil for one hour, or until wort gravity reaches 1.070, adding hops, Whirlfloc, and yeast nutrient at the indicated times. Chill wort and transfer to a carboy. Wait 15 minutes for the trub to settle out and then transfer again. Oxygenate for 2 minutes and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50° F (10° C) until kräusen falls, then raise temperature for a diacetyl rest until terminal gravity is reached. Cool to 14° F (–10° C) and hold for 12 hours to allow yeast to flocculate and chill haze to appear before fining with bentonite. Rack and repeat with Polyclar. You now have approximately 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of beer at 8% ABV. Boil another 5.5 gal. (20.8 L) of reverse osmosis water for at least 10 minutes to eliminate most of the dissolved oxygen in the water. Chill the water as quickly as possible to avoid oxygen pickup, and then rack your high-gravity beer on to the deoxygenated water. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes (5 g/L) of CO2.",

Bill Schneller thinks the best approach to brewing Belgian beers is to not be a slave to the guidelines. Most Belgian-style beers are yeast driven, with malt and hops playing supporting roles. Schneller says adding fully fermentable sugar to the boil is essential to making a high-gravity beer that's still dry and crisp. This recipe is a great example of how experimenting with malts and hops can still produce a beer that fits loosely into the Belgian guidelines. Flaked oats give it a smooth finish, while noble hops and yeast bring out the Belgian characteristics.

In 2015, AHA Governing Committee member Drew Beechum gave us his two cents on what it means to him to ""transform a beer."" For him, it all starts with location, and he lets location inform his ingredients. He might say, ""Drew, what's your water source?"" or ""Drew, what grows in your area?"" just to get his brain and palate ticking on the most appropriate beer to brew. In this recipe, he takes your classic Bohemian Pilsner recipe and transforms it into his own version of the style. The modified directions can be found underneath the ingredients for the classic style.
This recipe was originally featured in the March/April 2015 issue of Zymurgy.","Ingredients:

Bill Schneller has been a homebrewer for 15 years and brews mostly Belgian style ales. He knows they are mysterious, and the recipes act more like guidelines for developing your own. In his article ""Belgian Style Ales: Tricks of the Trade"" found in January/February 2005 Zymurgy magazine, he gives a few tips and tricks to brew a quality Belgian farmhouse ale. But how did the farmhouse ale come to be?
The flatlands of Flanders were once the setting of many small, independent farms. Naturally, they brewed beer. Not just because it tasted great and was an important part of their culture, but because it was a necessary food product, providing crucial daily nutrition. The brewing season was short due to demands for harvesting crops, among other things, and so the cold winter months were spent brewing for the entire year. Since the brewing season was so short the ales needed to remain stable in flavor.
Farms developed two ways to create a brew to help keep it stable over the year - increase the hops or increase the alcohol content. The two methods resulted in distinct beer styles - one hoppy and refreshing, the other a full-bodied source of nutrition. These homemade ales were extremely varied in taste and quality because they were limited to the farms where they were brewed and consumed. Farmhouse ales are a true testament to homebrewing. Check out Bill's Farmhouse Ale below and see what you come up with!","Ingredients:

The golden-hued ale uses wheat, oats and barley for the grist, a dose of noble hops to add floral notes and honey and molasses for more fermentable sugars and a hint of subtle complexity. Unlike more well-known styles of German wheat beers, like hefeweizen, kottbusser is fermented with a clean ale yeast, leaving little to not yeast character in the finished beer.
Grimm Brothers Brewhouse of Loveland, Colorado shared the recipe for their kottbusser ale, Snowdrop. Snowdrop earned a bronze medal in the 2015 Great American Beer Festival.

Scott Jackson, member of Keg Ran Out Club (KROC) and Foam on the Range homebrew clubs in Colorado, shares his split-batch pumpkin ale recipes in the 2013 Sept/Oct Zymurgy, a recipe he’s been brewing for over 15 years and has a few medals to show for it.
Jackson says you don’t need to harvest fresh pumpkins to make pumpkin beer. Although baking fresh pumpkins works, you don’t get the same consistency as you do with a can of 100 percent pure pumpkin. Use the pumpkin in the mash, which although tricky, gives you a beautiful orange color and a little sugar from the starches in the pumpkin.
The protein rest reduces the gumminess of the pumpkin, and the rice hulls help with the sparge and wort collection. He also suggests using one clean high alpha hop addition at the beginning of the boil so you don’t disrupt the pumpkin and spice flavors.
Once your beers are finally ready, a fun, tasty way to serve the pumpkin ale is in a glass rimmed with brown sugar and to pair it with pumpkin-based desserts.","Ingredients:

To brew Duck Slippers Session Helles, a step infusion mash is employed. Add 8 quarts (7.6 L) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132°F (56°C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water or add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (22.71 L) of runoff. Add 60 minute hops and bring to a full vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperature of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35-45°F (1.5-7°C) for 3-6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Directions:
Heat 2 quarts (1.9 l) water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towle around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains or learn how to make spent grain flour. (LINK)
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 l). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.

You might prefer to use fruitier yeast, like Wyeast 1272 or Wyeast 1335. Substitute any other hops, but try to use the same quantity as this recipe.

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/daves-dreaded-sunday-steam-beer/,Not Found,"The steam beer, or California Common, is an American original first produced in California during the gold rush (late 19th century).
While the origins of the steam beer name aren’t fully known, one explanation is it may have come from the steaming sound the beer made during the heated fermentation process, another is the warm conditioning caused the highly carbonated beer to spray when opened.
Anchor Brewing Company claims the name came from the steam emanating from the roof of breweries because there wasn’t any way to cool the hot wort during the brewing process. Brewers pumped the wort up to the roof and let the cool San Francisco air chill the wort, thus steam was often seen rising from rooftops across San Francisco.

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 10 quarts (9.5 liters) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132°F (53°C) for 30 minutes. Add 5 quarts (4.8 liters) boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C). Hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.75 gallons (22 liters) or runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When three minutes remain add the three-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 liters) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident ferment at temperatures of about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping.

Your favorite German-style lager yeast
Directions:
Heat 4 quarts (4 L) of water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains.
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 3 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When three minutes remain add the three-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat.
Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let it sit for 15-30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of cold water has been added. If necessary add cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (21-liter) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.

Look no further than this light-hybrid recipe which makes for a very lager-like Kölsch using only ale yeast.

Fix's opinion on Kölsch is that ""slightly bigger is better."" From his travels to Cologne, where the style originated, Fix thinks true, commercial examples of Kölsch are hoppier and maltier than described in the AHA style guidelines. Wheat is also an important element for achieving an authentic Kölsch character.

Barleywines are rooted in their strength, malt-forward sweetness and, in some cases, rampant hopping. But what if you want to push the limits of the style? What if you are seeking to brew an ""alternative barleywine?"" AHA Governing Committee member Drew Beechum set out with his club to answer that exact question, and one of the results was this recipe for Summer Time Wheat Wine.
This recipe consists of equal parts wheat and pale malt, with a touch vienna and honey. The mix of American and German noble hops make for a subdued hop profile, but a more aggressive ""west coast"" hop regimen can be used for a deliciously hoppy wheat wine.
But be careful if you plan to enjoy this beer at your next barbeque—the high alcohol content can go unnoticed among the smooth and slightly sweet ale. It's a sneaky one!

Spring has sprung, and it's time to start planning brews for the warmer months ahead.
In Belgium, particularly the French-speaking regions, saison was a style typically brewed on farms in the wintertime and enjoyed through the following spring and summer. Brewing gave farmhands something to do in the winter as well as a tempting beverage to motivate them through the day.
Mike Heniff, author of the following recipe, has spent a great deal of time quaffing his way through Belgium and exploring the styles and variations all over the country. His saison recipe keeps things simple, allowing for the yeast character and some hop bitterness to shine through. The result is a light-bodied ale perfect for quenching warm weather thirst, while still packing a bit of a punch. À votre santé!

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/peanut-butter-jelly-time/,Not Found,"According to the National Peanut Board, Americans eat enough peanut butter each year to make 10 billion peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. To celebrate National Peanut Butter Day (January 24), we're sharing this homebrew version of the classic PB&J.
This recipe comes from AHA governing Committee member Drew Beechum. Tired of ""the ubiquitous Peanut Butter Chocolate Porter/Stout"" rendition, Drew wanted to try a different way to incorporate peanut butter into his homebrew. He describes that the ""jelly"" character comes from a fruity yeast choice, and that the malt choices were made to emphasize the bread and toast characteristics in the beer.
Using peanut butter can be tricky, as the lipids found in a traditional jar of peanut butter are a classic killer of head in beer. In this recipe, Drew uses a powdered peanut butter called PB2, which has been dehydrated and had the oils extracted from the peanuts by the manufacturer.
If you can't seem to find powdered PB at the store, another way to do this is to decant the oil out in a jar of non-homogenized peanut butter at home. By letting the oil naturally separate out to the top of the jar, and then pouring it off the top every few days, you can decrease the oil and increase head retention in your beer.

Gluten sensitivity affects about 6 percent of the population, but that doesn’t mean they can’t share a homebrew with you! While the gluten protein is found in the most common brewing grains—barley, wheat and rye—brewers have a few different choices when it comes to brewing with gluten-free fermentables.
This recipe, which uses roasted chestnut chips, was featured in the May/June 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine, in an article about gluten-free brewing. Author Carolyn Smagalski commented that “Chestnuts have essentially the same nutritional content as malted barley except that the sugars are not as readily available. Amylase breaks down the starches and sugars to a fermentable level.” Expand your brewing horizons and give brewing with chestnuts a shot!","Ingredients:
5.0 lb (2.27 kg) roasted, dried chestnut chips
5.0 lb (2.27 kg) dextrose

Put about 5 gallons of room temperature water in a pot and add one tablespoon of amylase that has been dissolved in one cup of water per manufacturers directions. Place chips in a grain bag and steep in 5 gallons of water for at least 1-2 hours. During this time raise and lower the bag five to six times every hour or so to obtain maximum sugar extraction. During the the soaking and extraction process, the chips will absorb and retain about 3-4 quarts of water. At the end of the soak, you should end up with an amber-colored wort with a gravity of 1.016-1.020. Remove grain bag and drain thoroughly. Top off to 5 gallons (18.93L). Bring wort to a boil. Add Fuggles in a hop bag and continue to boil for another 30 minutes. Add dextrose and boil for 15 more minutes. At this time the gravity is usually 1.049-1.053. Remove from heat and steep Cascade in a hop bag for another 30 minutes. Remove hops and chill to pitching temp. Rack to fermenter, pitch,  and ferment at ambient temperatures, usually a little over three days. Once fermentation is complete, rack to secondary and add 1 ounce of 100 bloom type B clarifying gelatin as per manufacturers instructions. Mix thoroughly, clarify for three to four days. Bottle or keg as usual.","Note: for a darker brew, roast 1 to 1.5 lb (0.45 to 0.68 kg) of the chestnut chips at 350°F to desired color stirring every 10 minutes.

This recipe by Rick Debar of the Barrel House Brewing Company and Ray Snyder of the Bloatarian Brewing League is from the May/June 2008 issue of Zymurgy magazine. Bosmo’s Imperial Cream Ale was developed as a joint project between the homebrewers and the professional brewers of Greater Cincinnati. The name is in honor of the Bloatarian Brewing League’s iconic mascot, Bosmo; but the style is a tribute to the long history of excellent relationships between the homebrewing community and the professional brewers of the area.
Cream ale was chosen as the base style, because it was popularized in Cincinnati. Some people think ale brewers created cream ale to compete with the new lager beers in the latter part of the 19th century. Others believe the German brewmasters in America simply applied their experience with German ales to create cream ale. Either way we’re sure you will enjoy it!","Ingredients:

The following recipe appears in the March/April 2001 issue of Zymurgy magazine and is based off of a recipe originally published in The Complete Joy of Homebrewing by Charlie Papazian.
Here is what AHA founder Charlie Papazian had to say on this pumpkin beer recipe:
“Pumpkin Ale? Now, don’t discount this one so quickly. Pumpkins were used in colonial days as an essential ingredient in many brews. With a bit of tradition and modern art you can brew something that is as American as apple pie. Cucurbito Pepo (Pumpkin) Ale is not too assuming. With a medium body, adequate bitterness, amber color, alcoholic warmth and reassuring spices, this beer will be an incredible contribution to your repertoire of accomplishments.
“The spices that lend a typical pumpkin-pie character are not overdone, but they are optional if you choose to brew a simpler version. This is the kind of brew for which you invite friends over to help with the ceremonies of brewing. Surely a Thanksgiving or holiday season toast with Cucurbito Pepo Ale will be one of the most memorable. England, Belgium and Germany, eat your hearts out.”","Ingredients:
10 lb (4.54 kg) American 6-row pale lager malt
1 lb (0.45 kg) 20-40°L crystal/caramel malt
7-10 lb (3.2-4.5 kg) whole pumpkin
2 oz (56.8 g) Williamette hops (boiling): 10 HBU
0.5 oz (14.2 g) Cascade hops (boiling): 2.5 HBU

1 tsp (4 g) ground cinnamon
1 tsp (4 g) vanilla bean, chopped
0.5 tsp (2 g) freshly ground nutmeg
0.25 tsp (1 g) ground allspice
0.5 tsp (2 g) ground dried ginger

Boil Time: 75-90 minutes","Directions:
Chill some homebrew the day before so that it’s ready to enjoy on brew day. While the beer is chilling, slice the pumpkin in half and remove seeds and stringy “veins.” Roast the pumpkin in a 350°F (117°C) oven for about one hour or until soft. The roasted pulp will be used in the mash. Use a protein-developing step mash. Add 3 gallons (11.4 L) of 130°F (54.4°C) water to the crushed malt. Stabilize at 122°F (50°C) and hold for 30 minutes. Then add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of boiling water and thoroughly mashed pumpkin pulp. Add heat if necessary and stabilize at 148-152°F (64-67°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Add more heat and mash out to 165°F (74°C). Sparge with about 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Initial extract volume may be about 7-8 gallons (26.6-30.4 L). Anticipate a long, vigorous boil and evaporation of 2-3 gallons (7.6-11.4 L). Add boiling hops and boil for 75 to 90 minutes or until volume of boiling wort approaches 5.5 gallons (21 L). Then add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, vanilla and Irish moss and continue boiling 10 more minutes. Turn off heat. Add aroma hops and let steep for 2-3 minutes before straining hops and spices and chilling the wort. Pitch the yeast when cool. Bottle when fermentation is complete.","”
Darker Option
Adaptions to darken the beer made with this recipe were discussed in the March/April 2001 issue of Zymurgy.
Just adapt the recipe with roasted malts like Chocolate or Black malt, or perhaps use a porter recipe with pumpkin processing. You can always eliminate or lessen the spices used, which are traditionally found pumpkin pie.”"

Commercially brewed in France by Brasserie Grain d'Ogre (formerly Brasserie Jeanne d'Arc until 2002), Grain d'Ogre earned gold in Category 34*: French-style Bière de Garde at the 1996 World Beer Cup. Charlie scaled the recipe down for homebrewing purposes and provided this character description of the gold cup-winning ale:
""...Grain d'Ogre introduces itself in a corked bottle, virtually assuring a pleasant earthy, musty aroma. Appearance is crystal-clear and light amber in color. Well carbonated with a pleasant head. First aromatic impressions are a gentle, mild maltiness and musty cork character. Subdued ale aromatics contribute to an easy complexity without fruity esters. Full-bodied with a malty finish. The assault of malt and alcohol character on the palate highlights the beer's overall impact. Noble hop bitterness is soft and mild and generally balanced towards neutrality; hop flavor does not emerge. Pale malts with a hint of Munich and Caramamunich-type malts seem apparent, but the formulation is actually aromatic Vienna and French caramel malt"" (p. 240).

Part of the American ale style spectrum that proceeds from pale to amber to brown to porter, amber ales bridge pale and brown ales by adding body and sweetness and shifting the beer's balance away from the hops to the malt. Amber ales are sweeter than brown ales but will have more hop flavor and aroma dancing on top than a brown. Amber ales have become one of my favorite beers. I like the balance of these beers—they are very hearty and satisfying. This is my clone of Red Nectar Ale.","Ingredients:

Inspired by a long, rural tradition in Germany known as Kartoffelferien, or Potato Vacation, Hornst Dornbusch came up with this funky recipe to pay homage to the tuber that has long been of importance to Germany: the potato. Horst Dornbush, Brewers Publications author, presents this potato-beer recipe in the article ""Can You Say Kartoffelferienbier"" on page 41 of the January/February 2004 issue of Zymurgy magazine.
Named after a traditional, week-long break from school and work for potato harvesting in Germany, Potato Vacation Beer, or Kartoffelferienbier, is a funky ale that lives outside the realm of classic styles.
For a deeper look at this recipe and the use of potatoes in brewing, AHA members can head over to the eZymurgy online archive for instant access to this Zymurgy issue and many more!","Ingredients:
3.25 lb (1.5 kg) Pale two-row Pils or ale malt (2-4° L)
2.5 lb (1.13 kg) Munich malt (approx. 10° L)
6.5 lb (3 kg) Peeled raw potatoes at room temperature
1.33 oz (37 g) Bittering hops of 5% AA (Tettnanger, Fuggles, East Kent Goldings or Galena)
0.5 oz (14 g) Aroma hops (Tettnanger, Fuggles, East Kent Goldings or Willamette)

Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.048
Final Gravity: ~1.010 (will depend on yeast)
ABV: 5%
Boil Time: 60 minutes","Directions:
Using a blender or ricer, macerate the peeled, raw potatoes. Then make a quick, thick grain mash at temperature of about 156°F (69°C).
Use the least amount of water possible, but avoid lumps and dry spots. Then pour the potato mash into the grain bed and mix the grain and potatoes evenly for maximum exposure of both to all starches in the mash. Finally, top the grain/potato bed with about an inch of water at about 172°F (78°C).
All starch conversion should be completed within about 20 minutes from mixing the grain with the potato mush. At this point, you can start recirculating the wort for 15-20 minutes.
Sparge the wort into a brew kettle, and stop sparging when the kettle gravity is about 1.044. Allowing for 10% evaporation, this pre-boil gravity should get your brew up to the target OG of 1.048.
Add bittering hops 15 minutes into boil. Add aroma hops 10 minutes before the end of the boil.
Follow fermentation schedule above. Prime in bottles.","Primary: 5 days
Secondary: 14 days
Bottle Prime: 7-10 days
Extract-with-grains Option
Replace Pale two-row malt and Munich malt with 3 lbs (1.36 kg) plain light Pils or ale malt extract and 2.0 lbs (0.97 kg) Bavarian Munich malt extract. Because extract brewers need to convert potato starches without mashing (and there is no potato extract on the market), they need an additional 2 lbs (0.97 kg) Pale ale or Pils malt as grains for steeping with the potatoes.
Mix the pale malt with the macerated potatoes and about 2 gallons of colder water in a pot. Once the potatoes and grains are evenly mixed, heat the entire ""mess"" very slowly while stirring frequently to ensure an even heat distribution in the pot until the temperature has reached a target range of about 150-155°F (65 - 68°C). Then let the pot rest for another half hour, during which you want to maintain the temperature within the target range. Once complete, line a kitchen colander with cheesecloth, place the colander in a large bowl or your kettle, and pour or ladle the pot's content into the colander. Allow the mixture to drain thoroughly, which may take 15-20 minutes (shake vigorously every few minutes).
Mix the liquid you collected from the potato and grain ""mess"" with the 3 lbs of pale malt extract and the 2 lbs of Munich malt extract. Top off your kettle to your pre-boil volume and follow the boil/post-boil schedule as listed for the all-grain recipe."

Mash at 149° (65°) for 90 minutes.  When primary fermentation is complete, pitch sour mix and oak, hold temp at 65° (18° C), and wait until desired tartness develops before bottling.
Brewer’s Note:  “This Belgian style ale is intended to be a light bodied, tart and refreshing brew for a warm summer day.  It pours a hazy orange hue, with both sour and characteristic Brett aromas.  The flavor is reminiscent of sour cherries, currants, and Brett Funk, with some spicy yeast character, a moderate carbonation tingle and a dry finish.  Decant carefully as it is bottle conditioned and will contain some yeast sediment.”
Primary fermentation at 75° (24° C).

If you're a smoked beer fan, you will love this one! The cherry wood brings a lot of nice flavor profiles to this beer. It's balanced nicely by adding hops that are low in alpha acids (hop bitterness is not get along with the phenolic character of smoke) and honey malt to add sweetness. This beer was named after the late owner of Briess Malt & Ingredients Company, Roger Briess. This beer is a great reason to celebrate his enthusiasm. Enjoy!

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 11 quarts (10.5 L) of 140 °F (60 °C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132 °F (53 °C) for 30 minutes. Add 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167 °F (75 °C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of runoff. Add 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 20 mintues remain, add the German Hallertauer hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 1 minute remains, add both the French Strisselspalt and Mt. Hood hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55 °F (12.5 °C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35-45 °F (1.5-7 °C) for 3-6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

Pitch with dregs from old 1996 batch of homebrewed Lambic-style ale, and Wyeast 1968. Insert an oak stave that has been in other batches of lambic. The 1996 batch was brewed with the dregs from commercial lambics and Yeast Labs Pediococcus and brettanomyces lambicus. After 16 months add three cans raspberry puree and Wyeast 3526. Twenty-two months after brewing, add last can of raspberry puree.
Primary fermentation: 3 years in plastic
Bottle conditioning time: 1 year","Judges' Comments
High acetic sourness. Some fruit sweetness to balance. Strong sourness lasts through finish. Like a well-aged vinegar. Could use some more complexity like Brett in flavor. Some wheat. Raspberry not present. Could use more fruit flavor/aroma to balance sourness. Additional carbonation would improve presentation. Intense sourness with bit of raspberry in aftertaste, could use Brett to balance out the sourness and provide the refreshingly dry finish that's needed. Some oak might help."

Janet's Brown Ale is no stranger to the world of homebrewing recipes. Mike McDole took home a medal when this recipe won gold in Category 10: Brown Ale at the American Homebrewers Assocation (AHA) National Homebrew Competition (NHC) in 2004. The award winning recipe was then featured in Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer's book, Brewing Classic Styles, as an example of a bigger, hoppier American Brown Ale. In 2009, McDole took gold again at the AHA NHC with an updated recipe that he categoraized as Imperial Brown Ale, but this time in Category 23: Speciality Beers. Though Janet's Brown Ale deviates a bit from the style guidelines for a traditional American Brown Ale, surely you will not be upset by the higher IBUs and ABV after taking a sip!","Ingredients:

Sulfite according to pH of must (dosage chart at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/frameset.htm). Add CaCl2 and PME (not the same thing as pectic/pectolytic enzyme) 24 hours after sulfitization to help induce brown cap. PME may be added earlier during maceration to boost pectin load for keeving but CaCl2 is still added later. CaCl2 dosage assumes heavy pectin load; use less as needed. First racking was done on Day 36 when fully clear but not yet fermenting. No wild yeast fermentation within five weeks as desired so added 20 ml of actively fermenting cider containing Premiér Cuvée yeast as a seed culture. Observable fermentation began 10 days later. Yeast was grown in the cider to tie up critical soluble nitrogen-rich nutrients and remove them later at racking. Re-racked when the fermentation curve approached bottom (average 0.16 degree Brix drop per day over nine days and slowing). Bottled without preservatives.
Acidity of Must is pH 3.5 with Total Acidity 5.8 g/L (expressed as tartaric).

Start with 5 gallons of cider and freeze the remaining gallon. Unless you are starting with a pasteurized cider add sugars, yeast nutrient and Camden tablets or sodium metabisulfite 24 hours before you plan to pitch your yeast.
Rehydrate yeast according to directions on packet. You may wish to do a starter yeast culture, but I have found that it’s not always necessary for small (5 gallon) batches. While waiting for the yeast to rehydrate, vigorously shake or stir the must to ensure proper aeration and that the sugars and yeast nutrient have dissolved. Pitch your yeast and close primary fermenter with an air lock that is fairly resistant to plugging. After primary fermentation stops, defrost your frozen gallon of cider, or acquire a fresh gallon of pasteurized cider and add it along with your cinnamon sticks and cloves to the carboy that you will be racking your cider into. You should see a secondary fermentation kick off, so be sure not to bottle until the secondary fermentation has ended and your cider has clarified.",

Jose Gomera of East Patchogue, New York, a member of the Long Island Beer and Malt Enthusiasts and Brewers East End Revival, won a bronze medal in Category 27: Fruit Beer during the 2023 National Homebrew Competition Final Round in San Diego. Gomera, along with co-brewer and sister Albania Morales, brewed a blonde ale with guava that was chosen third out of 144 entries in the category.
Gomera and Morales were trying to fine-tune the hops on what they considered to be a solid blonde ale recipe, and they decided to try for a fruit beer since it was springtime. The result is a creamy fruit beer with a blonde ale base that has just enough hop and guava character to keep it interesting and, most importantly, refreshing. As with prior versions of this blonde ale, Gomera and Morales named the recipe after a Blondie song.","Ingredients:

This is a really fun and easy kettle sour recipe. We have made it with different fruits (and some vegetables) but like the raspberry the best. When not brewing for NHC, we will generally split this 8-gallon recipe into two batches and add different fruits to each. We brew on a Spike Solo, so this is a brew-in-a-bag recipe. Start with RO water and build profile. Mash in at 149°F (65°C) and hold for 45 min. Raise temperature to 154°F (68°C) and hold for 15 min. Mash out at 168°F (76°C) for 15 min. Target a mash pH of 5.2. Boil for 10 min. Chill to 95°F (35°C). Use lactic acid to pre-acidify your wort to pH of 4.4–4.5. Pitch the Lactobacillus. Purge the kettle headspace with CO2. (We have a kettle lid with a camlock fitting on top, and we run a line from our CO2 tank to the kettle and connect to the camlock. We tightly wrap the junction of the kettle and kettle lid with cellophane to attempt to seal the vessel. We purge frequently with CO2 as the beer is souring.) Hold kettle at 95°F (35°C) for 24–48 hours for souring. Target a pH of 3.2–3.5 depending on desired sourness. Once wort has soured, heat kettle and boil for 15 min. Add hops at 10 min. Add whirlpool hops and salt and hold for 15 min. at 185°F (85°C). Chill to 95°F. Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 95°F. As fermentation activity is slowing (usually within 24–30 hours), add the berries. We put the berries in mesh brew bags and drop into the fermenter. Hold for 2 weeks. Transfer beer to secondary. Add additional concentrated juice and salt to taste. Cold crash and add gelatin. After beer has cleared, rack to keg and force carbonate to 3.0 volumes.",

Bulk treat 10 gal. (37.85 L) RO water with 2 g each pickling lime, gypsum, and calcium chloride.
Follow low-oxygen brewing practices to the extent possible with your system. Techniques employed were pre-boiling and chilling strike water, purging tubing and grain bed with CO2, underletting mash, using a mash cap, and conducting a full-volume mash to avoid need for sparging.
Dough in at 144°F (62°C), then step mash at 148°F (64°C), 153°F (67°C), 163°F (73°C), and 170°F (77°C) for 45, 10, 45, and 15 min., respectively.

This is a full-boil extract-based beer. Preheat oven to 165°F (74°C). Crush grain malts and place in a grain bag. Heat 0.7 gal. (2.6 L) of Publix spring water to 150°F (66°C) in a gallon-sized pot. Add grain bag to hot water in the pot, then place the pot in the oven and allow grains to steep for 25 min. at 150°F (66°C). Meanwhile, heat 4 gal. (15.14 L) Publix spring water and 2 gal. (7.57 L) Publix distilled water to 150°F (66°C) in a brew kettle large enough to hold the full boil volume. After the steep, place a plastic colander over the brew kettle, remove the bag of steeping grains from the smaller pot, and place the grain bag in the colander. Pour the steeping liquid through the grain bag and into the brew kettle. Add the malt extract and maltodextrin and bring to a boil. After hot break collapses, add hops and boil for 60 min. Cool wort quickly and transfer to fermenter. Add additional Publix spring water if needed to obtain about 5.25 gal. (19.9 L) wort. Aerate wort and pitch yeast when wort temperature is 64°F (18°C). Ferment for three days at 64°F (18°C) and then allow temperature to gently rise to 68–70°F (20–21°C) until fermentation is complete, about 4 days. Check beer with hydrometer to ensure fermentation is complete (readings should be the same on three consecutive days). Bottle with 5.2 oz. (147 g) priming sugar and allow filled bottles to carbonate at room temperature for at least three days. I prefer to allow beer to age for an additional week or two before drinking.",

* * *
I’ve always had challenges with the name “bitter.” Bitter is not a very romantic name for a style. One would never name a wine style “acidic.” Yes, the style name “bitter” pre-dates sensory terminology by several hundred years, but like any homebrewer, I have the power to change things I brew, so I will henceforth encourage the world to refer to ESB as Extra Special Beautiful.
Now on to my quest to perfect this style. I’m personally favoring Strong Bitter (11C in Beer Judge Certification Program 2021 Guidelines) over Ordinary and Best Bitter. It has more girth, mouthfeel, and residual sugar, yet is still very sessionable, with an ABV range of 4.6 to 6.2%.

Peter shares the following of his award-winning recipe:
Inspired by a visit to a new, local craft brewery called Oakflower in Millington, New Jersey, this beer started life as an experiment to see what a 100% Citra-hopped hazy IPA would be like. Two iterations later it medaled in the National Homebrew Competition!
The key parts about brewing this beer are:
Boil the mash water and then cool before mashing.
Start the first dry hop no sooner than day 7
Lower the hopping temperature for both the first and second dry hop.
It goes without saying that oxygen is not your friend when it comes to heavily hopped beers, so closed transfer is essential when kegging. One final piece that I have recently found to be successful: dissolve 5 grams of Ascorbic Acid in 50 milliliters of distilled water and inject it through the gas quick disconnect prior to carbonating and conditioning.","Ingredients:

This is a great recipe that I’ve come back to a couple times and brewed in multiple ways. Anytime you need a good drinking beer, this is a go-to, and it is usually affordable. It’s modeled after one of Ghostfish Brewing Co.’s most-awarded flagships, Grapefuit IPA.
Zero Tolerance members demonstrated this beer for a seminar and club night at Homebrew Con. I wanted a recipe that people would find difficult to distinguish between all-grain and extract, but would still be easier to source than other gluten-free recipes.
The toughest part is getting around the flavors that sorghum produces. Many claim to taste a metallic or chlorophenolic “twang” when they try sorghum beers. That is why we rely on grapefruit-tasting Yakima Valley Hops Experimental Grapefruit hops and, optionally, grapefruit peel. By leaning into the flavor distance, we’re making something undesirable desirable.
I suggest using yeast nutrient since dry yeast sometimes has trouble finishing sorghum. It’ll help achieve full attenuation when you do start using grain.
This recipe tastes great with the zest of one grapefruit in secondary. Just soak the zest in vodka while primary fermentation takes place and add the entire tincture to secondary along with the dry hops.","Ingredients:

Age hops in open bags for over a year, or until they smell more of hay than cheese. Unmalted grains and boiled oats make the total efficiency lower than calculated.

Although a neutral/wine barrel is preferred, I obtained this 15 gal. barrel from a friend in the club who had been aging excellent sour beer in it. Initially, he had opened the barrel and stripped it of char. It also had a hefty Brett culture thriving in it when I filled it. I have waxed around 2/3 of the staves and one head. After each Solera turn, I top off the headspace with a starter of whatever Brett culture I can buy at my LHBS at that time. Periodically I also add dregs of good beers that are in the same vein as this golden sour ale and conditioned without wine yeast. After kegging, keep at room temp until tetrahydropyridine (THP), if any, is aged out of the beer. Force carbonate medium-high/high.",

Target a relatively high mash temperature so that the beer finishes near 4°P (1.016). I recommend 155–160°F (68.3–71.1°C). Add the gruit blend 5 minutes before flameout, or steep after flameout for 15 minutes, agitating every 3–5 minutes (I prefer the results of flameout steeping.) Filter the beer through wheat straw post-fermentation. This beer would have been consumed still, but it is very tasty and stable as a carbonated beverage.

Make your yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. In the kettle, heat 4.1 gallons (16 L) of water to 113° F (45° C) and mash in with grain to stabilize at 104° F (40° C). Mix grain into the water and stir the mash quietly to minimize the amount of oxygen entrained in the mash. Immediately start heating the mash to 122° F (50° C). Stir continuously but gently as the mash heats. The temperature should rise by approximately 2° F (1° C) per minute. When the mash reaches 113° F (45° C), pause for 5 minutes, and then resume heating to 122° F (50° C). Rest here for 15 minutes, and then pull a decoction equal to about 40 percent of the mash volume. Choose the thickest part of the mash. Transfer this to a large pot and begin heating, gently. Stir gently and continuously as you heat. You may need to add water if the decoction gets so thick that scorching is possible. When the decoction reaches 158° F (70° C), rest until an iodine test comes back negative, and then continue heating. Boil the decoction for 20 minutes, stirring (gently) nearly constantly. You may occasionally need to heat the main mash to hold its temperature at 122° F (50° C). Return the decoction to the main mash with as little splashing as possible. Stir and adjust temperature, if needed, to 149° F (65° C). Hold at 149° F (65° C) for 15 minutes, then heat mash—stirring (quietly) almost constantly—to 158° F (70° C). Rest at 158° F (70° C) until a negative iodine test is returned, then begin heating the mash to 168° F (76° C). Quietly transfer the mash to the lauter tun. Recirculate for about 20 minutes, then begin running off wort. Sparge with water hot enough to hold the grain bed temperature at 168° F (76° C). You will need about 3.7 gallons (14 L) of sparge water for this. Collect 6.3 gallons (24 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops for the final 60 minutes. Cool the wort to 54° F (12° C). Transfer 3.6 qt. (3.4 L) of this (chilled, not aerated, not pitched) wort to sanitized Mason jars. Store jars in a refrigerator until needed (as speise). Transfer the remaining wort—4.4 gallons (17 L)—to a sanitized bucket fermenter, aerate the wort, and pitch the sediment from the yeast starter. Ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). Take the lid off the bucket for the 1 to 2 days when the fermentation is at it’s most vigorous. Reseal the bucket and affix the airlock, and resume a closed fermentation, after this period. (If you’d like, you could crop some yeast from the fermentation before sealing the bucket.) After fermentation stops, allow the beer to settle for 4–10 days. Prime the beer with speise, add lager yeast, and bottle in heavy bottles. Store the beer warm for 2 weeks to bottle condition to 4.0 volumes of CO2.",

Make your yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. Heat 3 gallons (11 L) of water to the proper strike temperature to mash in at 149° F (65° C). If your malt and equipment is at room temperature, the strike water temperature should be around 160° F (71° C). Mash at 149° F (65° C) for 60–75 minutes. Mash out at 168° F (76° C) and recirculate. Collect 5.9 gallons (22 L) of wort. You’ll need about 3.5 gallons (13 L) of sparge water for this. The sparge water should be heated enough that the grain bed remains around 168° F (76° C). Boil the wort for 60–75 minutes. (You may need to add boiling water to keep the volume from dipping below 5 gallons/19 L.) Add hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort to 54° F (12° C). Aerate and pitch yeast from yeast starter. Let ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). After fermentation stops, allow the beer to sit for 3–7 days.

Hold temperature as close to 150° F (66° C) as you can reasonably manage over this period. (This is a small mash.) Stir occasionally. Additionally, heat 0.5 gallons (2 L) of water to 170° F (77° C) in a small pot and heat 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water to a boil in your brew pot. When the mash is over, place a colander over your brew kettle and place the grain bag in it. Pour the wort from the small mash through the grains (to filter out any large bits of grain) and rinse with the 170° F (77° C) water. Set grain bag aside. Dissolve roughly half the malt extract in the brew pot and resume boiling. To dissolve the malt extract, put it into one of the pots you used previously. Ladle hot wort from the brewpot onto it and stir to “pre-dissolve” it a bit. Then, stir it into the brewpot liquid. This will help ensure that none of the heavy extract sinks to the bottom of the pot and scorches. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Do not let boil volume dip below 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) during boil. Top up with boiling water, if needed, to avoid this. Stir in the remaining malt extract during the final 10 minutes of the boil. When the boil is finished, cool the wort to 54° F (12° C), or as cool as you can get it with a reasonable effort. Transfer to a sanitized fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment, allowing the temperature to creep up to 64° F (18° C). Prime beer with corn sugar in bottling bucket. If using standard beer bottles, prime for 3 volumes of CO2 using 6.5 oz. (180 g) of corn sugar. If you are using heavy wheat beer bottles, prime for 4.0 volumes of CO2 using 9.5 oz. (270 g) of corn sugar. Store bottles somewhere warm for two weeks. Check for carbonation and move beer to cold storage.",

In an article in 2005,  Bill Schneller wrote about the tricks of the trade when it comes to brewing Belgian-style beers. Schneller mentions that Belgian styles are a great place to experiment with adjuncts like corn, wheat, or rye. Corn, that all-American adjunct, is great in Belgian-style ales because it keeps its color and body light. The combination between the flaked corn and the sugar creates a lighter beer and accentuates the yeast aromas.

Expect a complex yet delicate ale with a big, billowy white head.

Directions and tasting notes for Wynkoop Colorojo Clone courtesy of Andy Brown. We boil our Denver city water before the brew day and acidulate it with gypsum or acidulated malt. The single infusion mash temperature for this beer is at 154°F (67.5°C) for 50 minutes. We sparge with 170°F (77°C) water for mash out and get a pre-boil gravity of about 1.068 or 17 Plato. The first hop addition is 10 minutes after a good rolling boil is established. After the boil, we steep the zero minute hop addition for about 15 minutes and knockout the hot wort through the whole leaf hops in a pressurizable hop back that I made from an old filter housing. You could use your mash tun as a hop back if you don’t have a hop back. We ferment at 69°F (21°C) and then after 10 days rack the beer to a conditioning tank, adding the whole leaf dry hops in weighted infusion bags. After eight days of dry hopping, we rack the beer to a serving vessel, add finings, carbonate and serve after 72 hours.","Tasting Notes
""I really like the American imperial red ales that have the maltiness to back all the hops we add. Colorojo has a deep reddish brown color and some haze because it is unfilitered. The IBUs are not out of hand and I like being able to keep the three hop varieties distinct in the flavor and aroma of the beer. El Dorado is a new hop variety with interesting tropical fruit and juicy candy flavors, but Amarillo really steals the show as the signature hop for this beer with its tangerine flavor. Drinking this beer is like biting into a really bitter blood orange. I know some of these hop varieties are hard to come by the Wynkoop I will be happy to get you some of ours for your clone homebrew. Just save me a bottle!"" - Andy Brown

During the course of fermentation, dregs of several sour beers were added to fermentation including Gueuze Girardin and a homebrewed Sour Blonde Ale (~12 separate batches that were brewed by different homebrewers and blended) that was aged in an oak barrel that previously contained New Belgium La Folie. Soak 2 oz (57 g) of medium toast French oak cubes in Daron Calvados (enough to completely cover oak cubes) for a couple weeks. Add oak cube/Calvados mixture to beer and age an additional 3 months or until desired character is achieved. Transfer beer to keg and force carbonate to ~2.5 volumes of CO2. After a while of enjoyment on tap, bottle using counter pressure bottle filler. Age bottles at cellar temperature (in this case ~8 months); pellicle will form in the bottle and character will develop for many years.
Primary fermentation for 3 weeks at 60-65° F (16-18° C).
Secondary fermentation for 9 months at 70° F (21° C).

Final Gravity: 1.021
ABV: 8.40%
SRM: 7","Directions:
Mash at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Do not oversparge—a smaller pre-boil volume than normal is fine given the small grain bill. Boil for 60 minutes. Add DME at end of boil. Top up with cold water if necessary to reach target volume/gravity. Ferment two weeks at 68° F (20° C) in primary, then transfer to secondary and condition for three weeks at 68° F (20° C). Bottle prime with 5 oz + 2.5 tsp of dextrose for 2.75 volumes of CO2. Rest bottles in cellar for at least 2 months.
Brewer’s Note: I used homegrown hops with unknown AA% (lower than commercial Centennial hops). Because of the smaller boil volume and the fact that a strong boil is not needed for the style nor to boil off liquid, this recipe is ideal for a 5 gallon pot on a stovetop. I have not tried an extract-only version, but it seems that 8 lbs of Wheat DME and 1.5 lbs table sugar would do it. Boil maybe 3 lbs of the Wheat DME and the 1.5 lbs sugar for 60 minutes, then add the rest of the DME at the end of the boil.
Primary fermentation for 2 weeks at 68° F (20° C).
Secondary fermentation for 3 weeks at 68° F (20° C).

No-sparge method with 10 gal. of reverse osmosis water (3.48 qt./lb.). Mash in with initial temperature of 151° F (66° C). Rest for 4 hours, during which time the mash temperature may drop as low as 142° F (61° C). Raise temperature to 156° F (69° C) by applying direct heat and recirculating. Run off to kettle and boil for 90 minutes. Chill to 46° F (8° C) and pitch yeast with 90 seconds of pure O2. Monitor temperature using thermowell in carboy. Ferment at 48° F (9° C) until gravity reaches 1.020 (approximately 5 days). Let rise to 52° F (11° F) until gravity reaches 1.012 SG (approximately 2 days). Let rise to 62° F (17° C) until completion (approximately 3 days). Closed transfer to fully CO2 purged and sanitized keg. Chill to 32° F (0° C) and lager for 2 weeks. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes (5 g/L) of CO2. The very long mash time is a function of convenience, but creates a very fermentable wort. Use gelatin fining if required to clear after lagering. (1 tsp. in 200 mL distilled water, heated to 150° F (66° C)). Lager and add fining at 32° F (0° C). Serve at 38–40° F (3–4° C).",

From Charlie Papazian: ""Although the honey may seem unusual for this traditional style of beer, it adds a character reminiscent of Authentic Czech pilsener. It is one malt-extract beer that has come close to the lusciousness of the twentieth-century brewed Pilsner Urquell or the original full-flavored and wonderful malt- and hop-graced Czech Budweiser. The use of light honey in this recipe helps introduce the character of a light-bodied pilsener while celebrating the roundness of malt and the crispness of hops. Simply brewed, Propensity Czech Pilsener is a treat for the connoisseur of true, traditional, and original Czech-style lagers.""","Ingredients:
5 lb (2.27 kg) Plain light dried malt extract
1 lb (0.45 kg) Crystal malt

Add the cracked crystal malt to 1.5 gallons of cold water and bring to a boil.
When boiling has commenced remove the grains with a strainer.
Add the malt extract, honey and boiling hops and boil for 45 minutes.
Add the Tettnanger hops 10 minutes before the end of the boil.
Add the Saaz during the final 1-2 minutes of the boil. Sparge immediately and add the hot wort to the fermentor and cold water.
Add yeast when cool and bottle when fermentation is complete.
Propensity Pilsener can be matured for 3-4 weeks in the bottle at room temperatures and longer at cool temperatures. Drink and appreciate when you are ready!

After racking an English dark mild to a keg, we decided to put some old orange blossom honey and the must and oak chips from an even older wine kit on top of the mild’s yeast cake. Fermentation was sluggish, so K1-V1116 was directly pitched on day 2 of primary fermentation. Fermentation stopped at 1.087, so we made a starter of EC-1118 yeast with a little honey and pitched it at high kräusen. The mead only dropped to 1.084 and was sticky sweet, like grape jelly. We balanced the sweetness with citric acid and wine tannin and added the peanut butter whiskey to give it a PB&J flavor. It was still sweet, so we carbonated it to 1.5 vol. (3 g/L) CO2 in a 2-liter bottle with a carbonation cap just prior to bottling for competition, and something really changed. There are many ways to achieve balance in a mead, and we are glad we finally figured this one out!",

Clean and sanitize all equipment before making mead. Mix 5.1 lb. (2.31 kg) honey, 6 qt. (5.68 L) pear juice, and enough spring water to reach 5 gal. Add pectic enzyme and nutrients. Because kveik yeast works so quickly at high temperatures (this mead finished in less than a week), treat the must as high YAN (yeast-assimilable nitrogen) and add all nutrients (i.e., do not stagger) before pitching yeast. Oxygenate (or stir vigorously) for about a minute prior to pitch. No starter was used, just pitch the pouch. This mead was fermented in a bucket wrapped in a honey warming blanket. The blanket maintains a fairly consistent temperature of around 100°F (38°C). If you don’t have a blanket, we have also made this mead by fermenting in our garage in the July/August Midwest heat. The temperature is not as consistent due to ebbs and flows from day to night, but it was still warm enough to do the job. Stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate before back-sweetening. The honey for back-sweetening was about 3 lb. (1.36 kg), adjusted to around 1.025 (6.25 Bx), but this is personal preference. Use tartaric acid to adjust acidity of final mead, again to preference. Clear with SuperKleer KC. This mead is pétillant and was carbonated in a keg. Cheers!",

I did this as two separate honey fermentations (clover and eucalyptus) that I blended together, but you could do them together if that’s easier. For a 5-gallon batch, use 9 pounds each and dilute with water to hit an OG of 1.125, assuming that you’ll get about 100 gravity points of attenuation from the yeast. You can always back-sweeten to whatever level of sweetness you prefer, I like this to be semi-sweet and 1.015–1.020 final gravity. Rehydrate 10 g (2 packs) of Lalvin 71B in 250 mL warm water with 12.5 g GoFerm. Use staggered nutrient additions of 7 g Fermaid O at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days. Primary will take 21–30 days, then rack and clarify (I like Sparkolloid). I used a 5-gallon used whiskey barrel seasoned with 750 mL locally sourced gin, but you could also use oak cubes, spirals or chips. Let it sit and taste every few days until you are happy with the oak and gin contribution—that was 30 days for me.

I probably made this more complicated than I needed to. It started as a test. In a previous life, I was the director of import sales for Pacific Resources Inc,, the largest importer of Manuka honey from New Zealand. I wondered what Manuka would taste like in a cyser, so they gave me some to test with. Because I wasn’t sure how strong the flavors would be, I started by making four 1-gallon batches by diluting Manuka honey into apple juice; 1.3 lb., 2.6 lb., 3.9 lb., and 5.2 lb., topping off each jug with apple juice. Obviously the OGs were crazy high for the last two, but I went with it: 1.076 (18.5 Bx), 1.110 (26 Bx), 1.170 (38.25 Bx), 1.200 (43.9 Bx). I added the QA23 to each and let them ferment separately for four months yielding the following FGs: 1.000 (0 Bx), 1.004 (1 Bx), 1.054 (13.25 Bx), 1.134 (31 Bx). Upon tasting, the batches were on a continuum of astringent/bitter to very sweet, as they were still high in sugars. I played with different combinations of mixing the four, and finally settled on just racking all four of them to a 6-gallon (22.71-L) carboy along with 2 gal. (7.57 L) of unfermented apple juice and some Campden tabs. Then I popped it into the fridge for a cold crash. Once everything settled, I added some potassium sorbate and racked to a sanitized keg, where I forced carbonated it. Finally, after it was fully carbonated (a little over carbonated to compensate for bottling), I used the Last Straw to bottle the cyser for sharing!",

7 lb (3.15 kg) Linden/Basswood or Heather honey
4.3 G (16.3 L) low carbonate/sulfate chlorine/chloramine free water
20 oz. (570 grams) of thin juniper branches preferably with berries (30 grams/L)
6.25 grams GoFerm Protect (with 125ml water)
16.4 grams Fermaid O (FAN source) (with 290ml water)
5 grams Meadowsweet (dried)

SRM: 1.5","Directions:
Heat water to 180F (82C). Allow to cool to 160F (71C) and immediately pour over the juniper branches. Infuse for a minimum of 1 hour (cover to retain heat, and/or wrap with a blanket), this step is often left to sit overnight.
When the juniper infusion is ready, taste it! If it does not have detectable pine/resin/spice you should stop and find another source for juniper branches. Alternate: Spruce or Fir tips, light green spring growth only, use 1oz per gallon – taste before using. Spruce and Fir tips can have a powerful impact!
Measure the GoFerm into a flask or beaker. Add 4 oz. (125 ml.) of 150F (65C) water and mix thoroughly. Allow the GoFerm to cool to 95F (35C).
While the GoFerm is reaching temperature, remove the juniper and incorporate the honey into the juniper infusion and mix thoroughly.
When the GoFerm has reached temperature, add the yeast. Mix thoroughly and allow it to “bloom” for no more than 10 minutes. Check the temperature of the must and the yeast. If they are within a range of 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees C) pitch the yeast into the must and mix thoroughly. Oxygenate the must to 10ppm (if this is not possible for you, whip air into the must for several minutes to reach approximately 6ppm O2).
If they are not within range, add 4 oz. (125 ml.) of must to the yeast to “atemperate” the mixture. Repeat this process every 10 minutes until the yeast is within the aforementioned range.
While the yeast is acclimating to the must, mix the Fermaid O into 10 oz. (290 ml) of 150F (65C) water. Allow the Fermaid O to cool to 100F (37C) and incorporate into the must. This is called “front loading”, and is a departure from the typically recommended 4 staggered nutrient additions.
Close up the fermentation container, put a blowoff tube in place or alternatively, an airlock.
Note: This will be a vigorous fermentation, you should ensure there is a minimum volume of 2G (7.6L) of headspace in the fermenter. Ferment at 104F (40C).
Ferment to terminal gravity (1.000 or less). It’s likely this will be reached within 24 hours, but let it ferment until it reaches terminal gravity.
Chill the fermenter to drop some of the yeast. Rack off of the lees to a new vessel. Stabilize the mead with Potassium MetaBiSulfite and Potassium Sorbate. Mix gently, and wait 4 hours for the SO2 sources to integrate.
Warm the backsweetening honey to 95F (35C), pull approximately 8 ounces (250ml) of the mead from the fermenter and incorporate into the honey until thoroughly mixed.
Add the Meadowsweet in a “hop bag” to the mead, and decant the backsweetening volume into the fermenter. Gently mix until well incorporated and let it sit for 1-2 days. Taste one to two times per day to assess the impact of the Meadowsweet addition. Pull the Meadowsweet as soon as it’s at the intensity you desire.
Rack the mead to a new vessel for fining. If you don’t want to fine you can enjoy as is, or wait until it’s clear. If you wait, you should have as little headspace as possible to avoid oxidation of the mead.
Enjoy!",

This mead is named after one of my favorite overheard comments when I was entering more often than I do now. Fermented upper 60s Fahrenheit. Not quite a Dwojniak (1:1 honey to water), but more like 2:3. Gravity is high enough that it is still wise to slowly introduce the yeast to the must over a day or two, and to step feed the last bit of your honey. Caramelized honey was done in a slow cooker, and I’m not very experienced at it. Most bochet I’ve had tasted burnt; I just wanted a light but noticeable warm, inviting caramelized character. Keep tasting, and remember it tastes darker than it looks as it is caramelizing, and be careful not to burn yourself. Don’t be in a hurry—this was a long-term project that took a few years before I was happy. I ended up doing a whole series of “cognac barrel” stuff. I didn’t source a used cognac barrel, although though that would be cool. I just use small (usually 10 L) new barrels, usually medium toast. First a cider would basically go in overnight to rinse some of the raw flavors out and giving me super oaky cider that I can use in small amounts for years in cider blends. Then I literally added a cognac I liked and rolled it around for weeks. No, you should not break out the XXO, but don’t cheap out either. Go for the most intense flavor for your buck–this is not the time for subtlety. After rolling around in the barrel, the cognac was dumped and a traditional mead was aged, then a pear mead, then this mead, and finally it was soaked in maple syrup and a spiced cyser went in. In each case, the barrel mead was intentionally a bit barrel-intense, as it was then blended back into the portion without the barrel. Perhaps I’ll eventually share the others if you ask nicely.",

Staggered nutrient additions. Fermented low 60s °F. I generally prefer to blend after fermentation is finished, but this was a project to use some honeys I labelled “difficult”—each had something I liked but also had at least one other character that I didn’t care for. In essence, I used them to dilute each other.
The blend included something like 11 honeys, but the four listed above comprised more than 90 percent of the total and will get you close. Not everything added was a success, frankly. Almond blossom is quite nutty, and toyon blossom is caramelly, smoky, and bitter. The heather honey—Hey, make sure it’s authentic, yeah? Lot of fake or dubious stuff out there—was also bitter, and some of the most intense floral character you’ll ever encounter. The buckwheat had heavy molasses, raisin, and fudgy characters. So again, the general theme is “too much X to use by itself, but good in a blend.”
I like D47 for traditional meads because of the flavor and mouthfeel it creates, and while some label it a “nutrient hog,” I like that it will reliably use the nutrients I feed it. Now that people are feeding their meads, I too often find they are left with a residual nutrient character that tastes gross. Fermented in the 60s Fahrenheit (upper teens Celsius), racked off sediment a couple times, and aged 1.5 years, before 1 gallon was briefly aged on medium-toast French oak and blended back in to taste.",

36 lb. (16.3 kg) dark wildflower honey
24 lb. (10.9 kg) eastern buckwheat honey

30 lb. (13.6 kg) dried Turkish figs
1 Tbsp. cloves

Original Gravity: 1.209
Final Gravity: 1.041
ABV: 16.30%","Directions:
Day 1
Make a 1.120 (28°Bx) honey starter using Uvaferm 43 yeast rehydrated with Go-Ferm.
Day 2
In a honey mixing vessel (something large enough to hold the entire volume of must, but not your fermenter), prepare your honey must with dark wildflower honey and buckwheat honey to 1.209 (45.8°Bx). You’ll likely need to use 5.5–6 gal. (20.8–22.7 L) water with the 60 lb. (27.2 kg) of honey. Later you’ll slowly transfer this must to the fermenter (see below). Add Opti-White at 1.9 g/gal. and FT Blanc tannin at 0.3 g/gal.
Add the yeast starter to the vessel in which you intend to ferment the entire batch (primary fermentation vessel); then add a portion of the must to the yeast starter in the primary fermenter, about 10–20 percent of the must. Be aware that you will eventually need to have enough room in the fermenter for the figs, about 12 gal. (45.4 L) total.
After yeast activity is noted (in about 1–2 hours), add another 10–20% of the total must to the primary fermenter. Repeat until all of the honey must has been transferred from the honey mixing vessel to the primary fermentation vessel (within 24 hours).
Day 3
Add 14 g DAP and 15 g Fermaid K (dissolve both of these in a small amount of water first to prevent foaming), stir to mix thoroughly, and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Day 4
Add 14 g DAP, 15 g Fermaid K, and dried Turkish figs. Stir to mix thoroughly and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Day 5
“Punch down” figs that are floating on the surface to mix and prevent mold.
Day 6
Add 14 g DAP and 15 g Fermaid K, stir to mix thoroughly, and oxygenate 90 seconds using a stainless-steel diffuser.
Days 7–21
At least once a day, “punch down” figs that are floating on the surface to mix and prevent mold.
Day 22
Remove figs, and place into a wine press. Press to remove as much liquid as possible. There will be some volume loss. Even though I started with 12 gal. (45.g L) of must, I was down to 10 gal. (37.9 L) or so due to absorption by the dried figs. Alternatively, you could strain instead of press, but the volume loss will be much greater.
Day 22 to 3 months
Add the cloves and allspice (I eventually racked off these spices a few weeks later). Allow any additional fermentation to complete for a few more weeks. Uvaferm 43 is a strong and steady, but slow, fermenter, especially towards the end If excess sediment forms, rack carefully off of any deep gross lees (fine lees are acceptable, though). By month 3, I had transferred most of the batch into a 8-gallon (30.3 L) neutral oak barrel. I reserved the extra leftover 2 gal. (7.6 L) for topping up later.
Month 3 and beyond
Allow to age slowly, occasionally taking small samples to taste and make sure all is proceeding as expected. Top up if needed. Rack off, sulfite (if you choose to do so), and bottle when done.
Additional Notes
Because of the high sugar concentration, there is always a chance of a stuck fermentation. Monitor progress of fermentation closely—if there are any signs of stuck fermentation, be ready to address by adding yeast hulls and making up a restart batch.
I used a neutral oak barrel that had already been used for three previous batches. I was not trying to get much oak flavor; rather I wanted to achieve the micro-oxidation Polish Dwójniak is known for.
Alternatively, you could age in a bucket or carboy, but it may be more challenging to achieve the intentional controlled oxidation we are aiming for. The goal is to age in the barrel for at least 2 to 5 years before sulfiting and bottling (I have not yet added sulfites as this batch is still aging in the barrel). Fining agents are typically not needed, as the tannins from the oak help with clarification, and the long-term aging itself allows the mead to become very clear over time. If there are any signs of over-oxidation or VA (volatile acidity), remove from the barrel immediately and treat with high-dose sulfites at 50–100 ppm.",

Freeze and then thaw cherries (measure Brix readings for each type) and place fruit into fermenter. Add Lallzme EX-V and Opti-Red according to instructions on packages. Wait 24 hours, add FT Rouge Berry tannins, and then add and blend honey on top of fruit. Make sure to take a Brix reading of your honey so you can estimate gravity calculations. At this point wait another 24 hours before pitching yeast to give honey time to blend well with the fruit and juice.
Rehydrate 25 g yeast with 33 g Go-Ferm and 650 mL spring water at 104°F (40°C). After 20 minutes, add an equal amount of must into the rehydrated yeast mixture and wait 20 more minutes to make sure yeast is active and happy. Repeat as needed to temper yeast to within 10°F (6°C) of must temperature. When that’s the case, pitch yeast into must.
24 hours after pitch, begin yeast nutrient additions. For this mead, I just did one pitch of 14.3 g Ferm-K and skipped the TOSNA protocol.
At this point, monitor fermentation and punch the fruit cap down into the must daily. After a few weeks, as fermentation slows, rack fruit off the must and strain it through a colander. Press the fruit to squeeze out extra juice and then rack mead back into carboy with the remainder of the juice. Continue fermentation until complete. Clear the mead using finings (my choice is kieselsol, then chitosan an hour later—Super Kleer packages have both).
Let the mead rest a week to settle and clear. Once cleared, rack off once more to another clean, sanitized carboy and add 8 cubes of medium-toast American oak. Age until it achieves the flavor you like.",

This recipe is written for a 1-gallon (3.8 L) batch, but you can make it whatever volume you like by scaling the quantities accordingly. Remember to include the volume of the honey in your water calculations—12 pounds of honey occupies one gallon (1.44 kg/L). So, if you make a 4-gallon (15.1 L) batch, you would need only 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water since the honey will bump up the batch volume to 4 gallons (15.1 L) total.","Ingredients:
HONEY
3 lb. (1.36 kg) Yirsa Farms Hairy Vetch honey

1.7 g Fermaid O, divided into four equal additions
Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gal
Original Gravity: 1.112 (26.4°Bx)
Final Gravity: 1.045 (11.2°Bx)","Directions:
Mix honey and water and cool must to pitching temperature. Pitch yeast and add pure O₂ for 30 seconds through a 0.5-micron stone (a stir whip on a drill works just as well and will keep you from over-oxygenating). Ferment at 60°F (16°C).
Add nutrients in four additions: (1) when active fermentation began, (2) at 1.100 SG (23.8°Bx), (3) at 1.086 SG (20.7°Bx), and (4) at 1.074 SG (18°Bx). The last of these is the ⅓ sugar break. You don’t need to be quite this exact, as long as you stagger the additions. However, I find making additions by gravity preferable to staggering by the clock. A sluggish start or fast fermentation could cause you to unintentionally front-load or miss the points when your yeast needs some nitrogen. That said, a lot of great meadmakers do it by time intervals, so do what works best for you.
I like to keep my nutrients in small, sealable, plastic fridge containers. Then I just add a little distilled water, shake it up, and add that to the fermenter. You can do this with a plastic zip-top bag, too. You want to know your yeast’s nitrogen requirements so you can adjust the amount of nutrient accordingly. You can usually find this information on the manufacturer’s website.
If you degas, do so twice a day for the first week—make sure to do this before adding any nutrients or you’ll have some great mead all over your floor. If you do a 1-gallon batch in a glass jug, I’ve found the yellow tops of the 1 lb. honey bears from the grocery store fit nicely on the top of the jug. Simply shake the fermenter and pop the top a few times to let out the CO₂.
Crash fermentation to 30°F (–1°C) at 1.045 (11.2°Bx). I usually have a ballpark final gravity target when I make a mead, and I start tasting when it reaches that mark. When I think it shows enough of the balance and flavor I want, I crash it. You could also dial down the original gravity to 1.066 (16.1°Bx), ferment dry, and then back-sweeten to your taste if that’s the way you want to go.
Use potassium sulfate and potassium metabisulfite to stabilize and Super-Kleer KC to clarify. Let it sit about a month at 30°F (–1°C) until you can read a sheet of text through it and then bottle. I transfer to a keg and then use a bottling gun.
I keep this one still, but I think pétillant would be very nice, too. The yeast really makes the vanilla notes pop, and it has a very soft mouthfeel that keeps the body from feeling heavy or sticky. The flavor is pleasantly balanced, with enough acid to make this very drinkable. I really dig this honey and definitely recommend checking out Yirsa Farms. This could be a good platform for a very nice metheglin as well.

20 lb. honey
Approximately 4 gal. water
Dry yeast weight: 16 g (two 8-gram packets) – Lalvin 71B-1122 – Ferment around 65°F (18°C) for best results (or use your favorite mead yeast’s recommended fermentation temperature).
20 g Go-Ferm
10.2 g (split in half) Fermaid O
11.4 g (split in half) Fermaid K
14.2 g (split in half) diammonium phosphate (DAP)
½ tsp/gal. potassium sorbate
1 tablet/gal. Campden tablet
Specifications:
Yield: 6 US gallons
Original Gravity: 1.121
Final Gravity: 1.020
ABV: 13%","Directions:
The honey should be of good quality—your mead will have flavors of the honey you use. If you like the subtle background flavors of the honey, it should make good mead.
Nutrients need to be dissolved in either must or water before being added to the larger volume of fermenting must. Stir or swirl your must gently before adding the nutrients to remove CO2 and avoid a honey volcano.
Mix water and honey well (I attach a blender to a drill and have my honey at liquid stage before starting). Gravity should be around 1.120. By mixing vigorously, you will oxygenate the must well, which is beneficial to yeast at this time.
Rehydrate yeast with Go-Ferm, add to room-temperature honey mixture, and allow to ferment for 24 hours. At 12 hours, you can mix the must again to introduce additional oxygen. After 24 hours of fermentation, add 5.1 g Fermaid O. At 48 hours, add remaining Fermaid O. At 72 hours, add 5.7 g Fermaid K and 7.1 g DAP. Add remaining Fermaid K and DAP when 1/3 of available sugars have been fermented (SG 1.080)
When your mead is done fermenting (several weeks)—specific gravity of about 1.025—transfer to new carboy for clarifying. You can add 1 Campden tablet (potassium metabisulfite) per gallon of mead and ½ tsp. potassium sorbate per gallon to stabilize fermentation and prevent renewed fermentation. If you want to avoid these, you will need to let your mead stabilize longer to make sure fermentation is complete and avoid bottle bombs.","Bochet Variation
Bochet uses caramalized honey rather than traditional raw honey.
For Caramelized Honey
Sucrose caramelizes at 320°F (160°C) and fructose at 230°F (110°C). Honey is approximately 38.2% fructose and 1.3% sucrose (with another 31.3% glucose). If you plan to make a 6-gallon batch of bochet, then you may want to caramelize in a large kettle over a controlled flame. You will need a container of at least twice the volume of honey you want to caramelize, as it will expand and foam up as it heats. I prefer to do mine in smaller batches in the oven, as I feel I have more control and do not have to sit over the heat as long. Use a candy thermometer to keep close attention to temperatures!
Oven 325°F (163°C) for 75 minutes. Watch temperature with thermometer so it doesn’t go above 275–280°F (135–138°C). Add a small amount of water to the honey as this helps early burning of your honey (the water will boil away). When the honey is about 270°F (132°C), it will be dark brown and start to get nice caramel notes. At 280°F (138°C) you will start to get some slight burnt notes, and the honey will be quite dark brown. By 290°F (143°C), you will have significant burnt notes and it will be nearly black.
Several other methods (flame, stovetop, slow cooker, pressure cooker) can be found online, so use whichever method works best for you. Generally, the upper temperatures will be the same for all methods. Caramelized honey is good; burnt honey is harsh and bitter, so watch that temperature closely."

This recipe has won medals through the AHA’s National Homebrew Competition (including a 2nd place award in 2021), the Mazer Cup, and other regional competitions. The star in a traditional mead is always the honey – any honey is usable, with local honey providing lots of options. The honey should be complex in flavor. Some good choices would be meadowfoam, orange blossom, tupelo, leatherwood, fireweed, coffee blossom, passion fruit, sage, buckwheat, complex local wildflower, or heather.","Ingredients:
3 lb. (1.4 kg) honey
0.75 gal. (2.8 L) water, reverse osmosis, or spring
0.17 oz. (5 g) DV10 dry yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) Go-Ferm, dissolved in 4.2 fl. oz. (125 grams) of water
0.1 oz. (3.75 g) Fermaid O, Fermaid K, or BSG Fermax, added in 4 equal doses

0.48 lb. (218 g) honey to back sweeten finished mead
Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gallon
Original Gravity: 1.108 (25 Brix)","Directions:
If you do not have reverse osmosis water (RO), any potable dechlorinated water low in minerals is acceptable.
Ferment at 62°F (17°C).
Prior to pitching the yeast, oxygenate must for 30 seconds. Make sure you mix the must extremely well.
Yeast Rehydration
Yeast health is important, so Go-Ferm should be used to rehydrate the yeast. The formula is 1.25 grams of Go-Ferm per gram of yeast, so for this mead recipe it would be (5 grams × 1.25) = 6.25 grams. Calculate the amount of water by multiplying the Go-Ferm amount by 20, which would give you 125 grams of water. I only use (RO) water, which I heat to 110°F (43°C) before adding the Go-Ferm. Add the yeast at around 90°F (32°C) and then pull some must and slowly temper the yeast mixture until its temperature is within 10°F (6°C) of that of the must. Whatever you do, do not let that yeast mixture sit for more than 20 minutes without adding some must.
Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA)
Staggered nutrient additions give the yeast vital nutrients to conduct a quick and healthy fermentation. We will keep it simple and calculate the amount of Fermaid O based upon the formula [(BRIX × 10) × YAN × GALLONS] ÷ 50. DV10 is a low-YAN (yeast assimilable nitrogen) yeast, hence the 0.75 factor for YAN. For this batch, it would be [(25 × 10) × 0.75 × 1] ÷ 50 = 3.75 grams of Fermaid O in four doses, which would be 1 gram per feeding. You will add 1 gram of Fermaid O at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pitching the yeast. If you are going to ferment cooler than 60°F (16°C) or warmer than 70°F (21°C), I suggest you change the YAN factor to 1.25.
Stabilizing
Before we add additional honey for back sweetening, you need to stabilize the mead so fermentation does not restart. To do that, you will add 1 gram of potassium metabisulfite and 2 grams of potassium sorbate. Mix these with a little water and then pour the mixture into the mead. Let this sit for 24 hours before you back sweeten. Technically, this should be done based upon pH, but if you do not have the ability to measure pH, I assure you the above calculations will be solid.
Back Sweetening
Say you would like your finished mead to have a final gravity of 1.020 (semi-sweet). That means you need to add 20 gravity points (1.020 – 1.00 = 0.020) to the finished mead. Divide those 20 gravity points by 35 (honey has 35 points per pound per gallon) to get 20 ÷ 35 = 0.57. You probably have around 0.85 gallons that need to be sweetened. Multiply the gallons of mead you want sweetened by this ratio, 0.85 × 0.57 = 0.48 pounds of honey. Mix that with some RO water and add this mixture to your mead after it has been stabilized.",

Specifications:","Directions:
Boil about 2 hours, uncovered, to reduce volume by 1/3. Skim any foam or debris that rises to the top (there may be very little if your honey is filtered). Add ginger and boil 15 minutes longer. Add citrus peel, remove from heat, and place lid on boil kettle to retain some volatiles.
Cool must to lukewarm with lid on. Simply leaving overnight in a cool place with the lid tightly fitted is fine if that fits your schedule. Transfer must to a clean, sanitized 1-gallon (3.8-L) or larger glass jar or small carboy, scooping or filtering the ginger and peel. As with any fermentation, be sure there is sufficient airspace for vigorous bubbling, and if using fruits or chunky spices, be sure they don’t reach and block the airlock.
Pitch yeast after the must is below about 85°F (29°C). A portion of the settled yeast from previous batches can be used—this slurry will keep at refrigerator temperature for several months. Swirl vigorously to aerate and fit with an airlock. Keep at room temperature, 60–70°F (16–21°C), for initial fermentation, which should begin within a day. Vigorous fermentation should ensue for perhaps a week, before slowing.
You can pour young, vigorously fermenting small mead directly from the fermenter into a chilled glass to drink if you don’t mind the haze. After fermentation settles down, you may choose to bottle it by racking to plastic soda or seltzer bottles and storing them in the refrigerator. Squeeze the sides of the bottles to push the liquid level up and minimize airspace. The mead will gradually clear but continue to slowly ferment. Loosen the caps to release accumulated CO2 if the bottles begin to bulge a bit.
In Digbie’s time, “stopping it very close” with cork or leather was not a hermetically sealed bottle as is possible with current caps or swing tops. Do not bottle this in modern crown-capped glass bottles! At best, opening them will create a geyser that wastes your precious small mead. At worst, your bottles will explode, potentially causing harm and also wasting your beverage. (Don’t ask me how I know this.)
If you are carrying small mead to a gathering and desire a classier presentation, transport it in a stable position to minimize jostling—chilled, in plastic soda bottles—and then transfer to a clear glass bottle with a removable stopper after arriving at your destination. A wine bottle will do, as will a clear 1-liter bottle with a swing-top closure.
This mead is best consumed within a month or two. Some bottles that I “lost” in the back of the refrigerator for a few months had definitely developed some off flavors. With the low alcohol content, there is also the possibility of growing undesirable microbial colonists over time, so drink it up soon!","Variations
MiniMaiMead
Try this version in May, or whenever local strawberries are in season. Use the basic recipe, with these changes.
Honey: use orange blossom, acacia, or linden (or any filtered, light-colored honey with a floral note)
Ginger: omit
Citrus: use peel of half a lemon
Add with citrus: 1 cup (240 mL) strawberries, halved or quartered if large (OK to leave leafy hulls on). Strain these out after cooling rather than transfer to the fermenter, as they discolor quickly.
Optional to add with citrus: one small, whole vanilla bean.
Add with yeast: about 10 stems, 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long of washed fresh or dried sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) leaves with or without blossoms.
Serve with a slice of fresh strawberry in the glass if you like.
If you can’t find or don’t care for sweet woodruff, alternative herbs include basil, lemon balm, lemon thyme, pineapple sage, chamomile, borage, and lavender (reduce the amount by half if using lavender, as it can be overpowering).
Winter is Coming Small Mead
As fall moves into winter, try this recipe, using the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: wildflower, preferably local
Ginger: omit
Citrus: peel of a tangerine or clementine
Add with citrus: 3-4 tender tips of white pine or balsam fir foliage
Add with yeast: rescue the last few rose petals or buds before the first frost; if you have no rose garden, add dried rosebuds with the citrus (try Middle Eastern markets or online) or a splash of rosewater
Figgy Pudding
Use the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: buckwheat or dark wildflower
Ginger: use slices of candied (crystalized) ginger if fresh is hard to find
Add with ginger: half a stick of cinnamon, a nubbin of nutmeg, a few blades of mace (optional), 3 or 4 dried figs, quartered, and 3 or 4 dates
Citrus: peel of half an orange
Note that the figs and dates, if they go into the fermentation vessel, will eventually settle as an unattractive (if tasty) sludge. Pour the small mead off the muck to serve or bring it out in opaque mugs rather than glasses.
For Your Honey - A Valentine’s Day Small Mead
Use the basic recipe, with these changes:
Honey: clover
Ginger: omit
Citrus: peel of half a lemon
Add with citrus: a few dried hibiscus flowers, or an herbal tea bag with hibiscus as a major ingredient (Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger is a good one)
Add with yeast: 1 cup (240 mL) deep red 100% fruit juice like cherry, pomegranate, or red currant"

This cyser scored a 45 at the 2019 Mazer Cup when it was 6 months old. My goal was to make a Chardonnay-style cyser. Chardonnays are often dry, oaky, and barrel fermented. You could attempt a malolactic fermentation step after the initial ferment, but that was beyond my scope this time, and I think the touch of lactic acid was good enough.
Since I didn’t have a barrel, I used a lot of oak cubes in primary. The difference between fermenting on oak and using oak later is that during fermentation, the yeast will eat all of the vanillin, leaving only tannic, spicy, and smoky contributions from the oak and less vanilla and sweetness.
This mead ends up being around 11.5% ABV. While this is immediately ready to consume at the 8-week mark and quite pleasant, I found that letting it age for 6 months from pitch brought back a lot of the honey and apple flavors, and it became much more complex.
Pectic enzyme and bentonite cannot be added together because bentonite denatures the enzyme, so wait a day between additions. Bentonite in primary is easily kept in suspension by the turbulence of fermentation, making it very effective. The combination yields a very clear mead almost immediately after fermentation ends. Fermaid O and GoFerm ensure a good, healthy fermentation with all the proper nutrients for the yeast. Sorbate and metabisulfite are stabilizers and an antioxidant to make sure fermentation doesn’t restart after back-sweetening.","Ingredients:

ABV: 11.50%","Directions:
Day 0 Mix 12.5 g GoFerm with about 250 mL of 110°F (43°C) water until it dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches 104°F (40°C), sprinkle yeast on top to rehydrate and leave for about 20 minutes. Mix cider and honey together until fully dissolved. Save 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of honey for back-sweetening later. Add 1 Tbsp. pectic enzyme and all of the oak to the fermenter. Pitch yeast and ferment at 62°F (17°C). Day 1 Take a few ounces of the must (possibly the same used to measure gravity), mix in 2.6 g Fermaid O, and return to primary. Add 2 tsp. bentonite by sprinkling on top (no need for the boiling water/slurry method). Days 2 and 3 Stir enough to degas some, but not enough to aerate (avoid splashing and vortices). Mix 2.5 g. of Fermaid O with a sample of must and return to primary. Day 4–7 Monitor gravity with daily hydrometer readings. On day 7, or when the gravity has fallen by 2/3 (whichever comes first), add the final 2.5 g Fermaid O feeding. Day 18 Fermentation should end between days 10 and 12. Gently stir or swirl to get everything in suspension, and cold crash for 72 hours. Day 21 Rack cyser and oak cubes from primary to secondary, and add 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite and 1 Tbsp. potassium sorbate. Day 25 Let sit for a few days, then back-sweeten with 1 lb. honey to about 1.002. A bone-dry gravity below 1.000 is generally unpleasant: here, back-sweetening is more to give a reasonable level of dryness than to actually make it sweet. Add an extra 1/4 tsp potassium metabisulfite to ensure stability. Day 35 This depends entirely on the cider you use and the effect you are going for, but I add some acid additions of 13.7 g malic and 5.5 mL lactic to sharpen the mead. The amounts will depend on the cider, the honey, and your own personal tastes. Conduct acid trials to find the right amount for your mead. Day 42 (Optional) Back-sweetening will likely have made your mead cloudy again. If it doesn’t clear on its own after a few weeks, mix 1 Tbsp. Sparkolloid with 1 cup boiling water and stir while boiling for 5 minutes. Add this to the mead and gently but thoroughly mix it in. You do not have to do this step if you are happy with the clarity of your mead. Let sit for 2 weeks. Day 56 At this point, the mead has been 8 weeks on the oak. I think this is the minimum: I get a good tannic character without it being too oaky, but if you’d like to leave it on the cubes longer it should be fine. Otherwise, keg or bottle. If kegging, store at room temp and serve at 2 to 3 psi (140–200 mbar) to make sure it doesn’t carbonate.",

Session-style meads are notoriously difficult because they often taste weak and watery. Blueberries are a great fruit for this style because they have good natural tannins and some acidity. If you taste this after it ferments to completion but before you back-sweeten, you might be surprised by the lack of blueberry flavor. That’s because some sugar needs to be present for the blueberry flavor to properly assert itself and be recognized.
You may think 20 lb. of blueberries is a lot, but 3 lb. per gallon is actually the standard. I went with 4 lb. per gallon for added flavor and presence. The measured original gravity may be much lower than the true original gravity since the sugar in the berries takes time to release.
A 6.5% ABV mead might not seem very sessionable. But again, because it’s hard to get good flavor in a session mead, enough honey needs to be added to make a good impression. Oak adds structure and flavor and rounds out the edges quickly after fermentation.
Back-sweetening gives general body and added flavor. The target sweetness of 1.015 is a good medium point—it isn’t overly sweet thanks to the balancing effects of berry and oak tannins and carbonation. All the components of this recipe have been targeted and used to make a nicely balanced and flavorful session mead that’s hard to put down (hence “vice” in the name). Make tweaks at your own risk, or at least consider their effect on balance.
Pectic enzyme and bentonite cannot be added together because bentonite denatures the enzyme, so wait a day between additions. Bentonite in primary is easily kept in suspension by the turbulence of fermentation, making it very effective. The combination yields a very clear mead almost immediately after fermentation ends. Fermaid O and GoFerm ensure a good, healthy fermentation with all the proper nutrients for the yeast. Sorbate and metabisulfite are stabilizers and an antioxidant to make sure fermentation doesn’t restart after back-sweetening.","Ingredients:

To prep, freeze your blueberries for at least 24 hours. Then pick out and discard any that have mold or look off, although smashed berries are fine. Possibly grab an extra pound to compensate for the loss of these throwaways. Day 0 Mix 6.25 g Goferm with about 125 mL of 110°F (43°C) water until it dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches 104°F (40°C), sprinkle yeast on top to rehydrate and leave for about 20 minutes. Of your 8 lb. (3.63 kg) of honey, mix 5 lb. (2.27 kg) in with 2.5 gallons (9.46 L) of warm water to dissolve. Save the remaining 3 lb. (1.36 kg) for back-sweetening later. Place berries in a mesh bag for easy removal later. Add the bag to the fermenter and fill with more water to reach 6 gal. (22.71 L). The berries will take up about 2–2.5 gallons (7.5–9.5 L) of space. Add 1 Tbsp. pectic enzyme to break down the pectin in the berries. When yeast solution is ready, ensure it is within 10°F (6°C) of must temperature before pitching. Acclimatize the yeast if needed by adding a tablespoon of the must to the yeast slurry every 30 to 60 seconds. Ferment at 62°F (17°C). If you are unable to keep berries submerged completely during fermentation, periodically open the fermenter and push them down to keep them wet. Do this at least every other day. Day 1 Take a few ounces of the must (possibly the same used for the gravity measurement), mix in 7.9 g of Fermaid O, and return to primary. Attempt to degas some by stirring, but the bag of fruit can make this difficult. Add 2 tsp. bentonite by just sprinkling it on top (no need for the boiling water/slurry method). Day 14 Fermentation should have finished between days 8 and 10. Remove the berry bag and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Ideally you will have between 5 and 5.25 gallons (about 19–20 liters) at a gravity of 0.995–1.000. Cold crash for 3 days. Day 17 Rack into secondary vessel. I like to use glass carboys to reduce headspace and to observe clearing. Whatever you use should be more air tight than an ale pail. Add 1 Tbsp. potassium sorbate, 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite, and 2 oz. medium toast American oak cubes. Age 6–8 weeks to try to get the most out of your oak: longer is fine, but this is the minimum. Around Day 65 Rack to a keg and add the remaining 1/4 tsp. potassium metabisulfite. Warm the remaining 3 lb. honey to loosen it, and add it to the keg to back-sweeten to about 1.015. Let keg sit at room temperature for 24–48 hours, shaking occasionally, to ensure the honey is completely dissolved. Chill keg with a CO2 head pressure of 8–10 psi (0.6–0.7 bar) for 1 week to carbonate.",

FERMENTABLES
10.5 lb of Mesquite honey
0.5 lb of Avocado Blossom honey (Backsweetening)
1 gal of Tart Cherry Juice (Lakewood brand or other)
4 cans of Oregon Fruit Tart Cherries

Heat up 200 mL of spring water to where it is hot but not necessarily boiling and mix in GoFerm. Set aside to cool to 104 °F and mix the rest of your ingredients.  In a 3-5 gallon fermenter, mix together the 10.5 lbs of Mesquite honey, Tart cherry juice, Opti-Red, FT Rouge, and top up with spring water to hit 3 gallon mark if needed. Once GoFerm mixture is at 104 °F, pitch the 71b yeast in to it and cover with a cloth for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes have passed uncover and temperate it by adding 5 mL of your must every few minutes. Do this until it is within 10 °F of your must and then pitch the yeast slurry in to your must.  Add 3 grams of Fermaid-O at 24, 48, and 72 hours . Then add the remainder at the 1/3rd sugar break or on the 7th day, whichever comes first. Stirring the mead with a wine whip is recommended twice a day for the first 10 days.  Once the gravity is stable and the mead is no longer fermenting rack to secondary on top of the 4 cans of Oregon Fruit Tart Cherries, liquid and all. The mead may start fermenting again which is fine. Once the primary fermentation is completely finished rack to tertiary, stabilize with sulfites and sorbate, and after 24 hours add the Avocado Blossom honey to taste or until it is at the Semi-Sweet level. Also adjust tannins and acids at this time to bring the mead into balance.  Bulk age for 2-3 months until clear and ready to bottle. This process can also be sped up by using Super-Kleer after a few weeks of aging. Once clear filter bottle and enjoy, this mead is able to be drank within a month after it’s finished but is even better with about 6-12 months of aging under it’s belt!",

Recipe by David Schmidt
Feel free to experiment with all-grain variants of this. You can stick to the lighter malts, which are the most commonly used when people make large amounts of t’alla for celebrations. For more complex flavors, try steeping teff, maize, wheat, and/or sorghum with the wort. If you want to mimic the smoky flavor of the traditional t’alla vessel, you might try substituting in some darker malt. This recipe uses honey, which many forms of t’alla call for. The key ingredient is gesho in place of hops.","Ingredients:
MALTS & HONEY
6 lb. (2.72 kg) pale dry malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) caramel/crystal 60°L
1 lb. (454 g) British crystal 70–80°L
1 lb. (454 g) honey @ 0 min
BOTANICALS

Mix the honey and water in your brew kettle and bring the temperature to 160–170°F (71.1–76.7°C) for 10 minutes to pasteurize. If you would like to sterilize the gesho, briefly dip it into a separate pot of boiling water to avoid imparting too many astringent flavors to the brew. (I threw caution to the wind and pitched it in dry.) Tie the gesho in a mesh bag and put it in when you pitch the yeast. Ferment for 10–14 days. Remove the gesho, stir the t’ej, and seal it up again. Let it ferment for 3–4 more weeks. You can always taste it after a couple weeks; if the sweetness is to your liking, refrigerate and serve at any point.","Variation: Cheater T'ej

Making wonderful mead is part science and part art. The science comes into play with recipe development, quality honey, yeast management through staggered nutrient additions, and appropriate fermentation temperature. The art comes into play post-fermentation. Unfortunately, mastering the art of meadmaking often can’t be described in a written recipe, and rather must be honed through experience and experimentation. Mix 14 lb. (6.35 kg) Mexican coffee blossom honey, 4 gal. (15.14 L) of 60°F (16°C) water, and 0.56 oz. (15 g) bentonite in a sanitized ale pail. OG should be around 1.100 with a volume of around 5.2 gal. (19.7 L), and temperature should be under 65°F (18°C). Add 0.5 ounces (14 g) of medium toast French oak cubes. Prepare yeast by mixing 0.69 oz. (19.5 g) Go-Ferm with 13.2 fl. oz. (390 mL) of 110°F (43°C) water. When the mixture’s temperature drops to under 104°F (40°C), sprinkle 0.53 oz. (15 g) of Lavlin D47 yeast and let sit for 15 minutes. After that time is up, give the yeast a vigorous stir and begin tempering yeast mixture to must temperature by adding 3.4 fl. oz. (100 mL) of must to the yeast every 5 minutes or so until the yeast mixture reaches 70°F (21°C). Oxygenate with pure O2 for about 60 seconds. Pitch yeast mixture, seal fermenter with an airlock, and ferment at 60°F (16°C). Add 0.18 oz. (5 g) Fermaid-O and 0.05 oz. (1.5 g) DAP in three separate feedings at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after pitching yeast. Ferment to a gravity of 1.000, and the mead will be nearly crystal clear thanks to the bentonite. Dissolve the label-recommended dose of potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate in 6.8 fluid oz. (200 mL) of hot water and add this to a sanitized 5 gal. (18.9 L) carboy. Rack mead on to this solution. Fill the carboy completely, leaving all of the primary sediment behind. A week later, back-sweeten to 1.035 (8.8°P) with about 5 lb. (2.27 kg) additional honey. Pour this honey into another sanitized 5-gallon fermenter and rack the mead over it. Stir to mix, and wait at least 2 weeks to fully incorporate. Pull a sample to verify gravity is around 1.035 and replace that volume with SuperKleer (again, per the label instructions). After a few more weeks, the mead will be extremely clear, with a small layer of gunk on the bottom of the carboy. Rack into another carboy (dosing with a bit more potassium metabisulfite) and top off with a bit more water if needed. Add 0.2 g/L tartaric acid, or to taste, to brighten the flavor, or do bench trials with smaller volumes and scale up to the full batch. Bottle in regular brown beer bottles with crown caps.",

Michael Wilcox of Wichita, KS, member of the Kansas City Bier Meisters, won a gold medal in Category #32: Spice & Specialty Mead during the 2019 National Homebrew Competition Final Round in Providence, RI with the help of Scot Schaar & Carvin Wilson. Wilcox’s Poltorak-inspired mead, a blend of 5 different meads, was chosen as the best among 149 entries in the category and earned him the title of 2019 Meadmaker of the Year.","Ingredients:

The winning mead in Category 32 was a blend of five meads made by three talented meadmakers. It is impossible to reproduce. Here, Wilcox describes what each mead contributed to the blend. Dwojniak/Poltorak with Raisins (Michael Wilcox) “The closest I’ve ever come to making a true Poltorak (2:1 honey to water ratio), this mead is in the range of 1.120 to 1.130 final gravity. I don’t remember what yeast it used, but I currently recommend Uvaferm 43 for all big Polish-style meads anyway. Between 1 and 1.5 pounds of raisins were used per gallon of mead, most in primary, and most were caramelized and mashed a bit on my stovetop before they went into the fermenter. (Yes, at this point, raisins are nutrients!) Make sure you’re using non-sulfited fruit. The honey is my typical blend of mostly acacia with a bit of non-enteric buckwheat: something in the 3:1 or 4:1 ratio is fine. It was never sulfited and has oxidized brilliantly. This mead is in the range of seven years old now, and really TOO sweet anymore on its own, but in this blend it brings up the richness for the rest of the batch. It spent significant time wood aging, including, for a time, a stay in what I had previously aged my attempts at Madeira in. There is chocolate and molasses and caramelized sugar here, tons of raisin, other dried fruit, a bit of nuttiness, and I do believe it picked up a bit of booziness from the Madeira. Lots of second-use oak, nothing too overt, lots of edges rounded with time and residual sugar.” Oxidized Mesquite Traditional Mead (Michael Wilcox) “Step fed, sack, and fermented with Lalvin K1V-1116 at around 70°F, to about 18% ABV. Finished at about 1.045. Big alcohol originally, but quite smooth now. Unintentionally oxidized with significant nutty (most would say walnut) character coming through. Several years old. This batch of mesquite also has a very woody character. After talking with a few others, we guess that something like creosote blooming around the same time may be giving this character. Whatever it is, it is a welcome character that I’m always looking for when I buy honey from the US Southwest. Adds alcohol, pronounced nuttiness, a woody, vaguely smoky character, and emphasizes honey.” Sweet Mead with Dates (Carvin Wilson) “This fruit character was the missing component that raisin and fig alone weren’t getting me. Beautiful honey character too, sort of a woody and clove-like spiciness, which could also be from the yeast Carvin chose. Fermented with AMH (Enoferm’s Assmanhausen): treat this yeast well, slowly introducing it to your must without shocking it with huge gravity or temperature changes, fermenting in the 70s Fahrenheit, following proper nutrient protocol, and it will treat you well in return. The dates are Deglet and Medjool, totaling about 5 pounds per gallon. If you don’t have access to that amount of dates or can’t spend that much, Carvin thinks one can approximate this mead with a single pound of dates added after primary with a clean yeast. A mix of mesquite and avocado blossom honeys was used, with an OG in the range of 1.160, and the mead was already 5 years old when I blended with it.” Dwojniak with Dried Fruits and Walnuts (Scot Schaar) “This is the mead you may have heard earned Scot his ‘Polish passport’ from a group of incredibly talented Polish meadmakers visiting the USA during Mazer Cup 2019. They told him, ‘You are one of us now.’ Awesome. This mead is big on walnut, which is almost exactly like a common oxidation character, and Scot has allowed it to oxidize for good measure. This mead emphasizes the aged and nutty quality of the blend and helps balance the less sweet components of the mead. In an approximately 3-gallon batch, a 1:1 ratio of honey is used, so 1.5 gallons of water, 12 pounds (1 gallon) of wildflower honey, and 6 pounds of bamboo honey. It was fermented with Uvaferm 43 yeast with temperatures in the mid to upper 60s Fahrenheit. Head space was left in secondary to encourage oxidation. Fourteen months after pitching and after 10 months in secondary, 8 ounces of dried black currants, 12 ounces of white figs, 12 ounces of black mission figs, and 2 pounds of chopped walnuts were added. Alcohol is in the 15% range, and final gravity is unknown, but I expect something in the 1.090 range would get you close. The mead is almost three years old at this point.” Sweet Mead with Figs and Bamboo Honey (Scot Schaar) “This mead won Scot the 2017 Meadmaker of the Year award. It was printed in Zymurgy two years ago, so go look it up. The heavier, richer, vaguely molasses-like, a-bit-like-buckwheat-honey nature of the bamboo honey was welcome. The figs just emphasize the dark fruit, dried fruit, and oxidized characters and don’t stick out as much as the other fruit in the final blend, but you’d notice the difference if I left them out. This mead also gave the blend a championship pedigree I thought we could use.”",

Mead Day 2019 Official Recipe
Try your hand at this semi-sweet mead made with Madagascar vanilla bean and Saigon and Vietnamese cinnamon. Prairie Rose Meadery in Fargo, N.D. suggests pairing this with almost any sweet dessert. We think a Mexican hot chocolate cake would be perfect!","Ingredients:
20 lb Clover honey
3 gal Water, charcoal filtered
2 pkgs Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
12.5 g GoFerm
10 g Fermaid O
10 g Fermaid K
6.6 g Diammonium phosphate (DAP)
1 Madagascar vanilla bean
3 Saigon/Vietnamese cinnamon sticks
Fining/Clarifying agent
Specifications:
Yield: 6 gallons
Original Gravity: 1.128
Final Gravity: 1.020|1.020
ABV: ~14%","Directions:
Heat water to around 110° F to help the honey mix in well. Add enough honey to reach gravity of 1.128. Cool must (unfermented mead) to 67° F. Rehydrate 2 packets (10 grams) of Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast in 115° F water with 12.5 grams of GoFerm. Let sit for about 20 minutes until foamy and add to must. Aerate wort either by stirring rapidly or directly adding O2 for a few minutes until the must is foamy. Nutrient Schedule IMPORTANT: The times noted are hours after the yeast was pitched. Also, before adding any dry nutrients, swirl the must to remove any CO2. This will help you avoid violent volcano-like activity in your must. Repeat this process before every nutrient addition.
12 hours: oxygenate the must again
24 hours: add 5 grams of Fermaid O
48 hours: add 5 grams of Fermaid O
72 hours: add 5 grams Fermaid K and 3.3 grams DAP
When gravity drops to around 1.086: add 5 grams Fermaid K and 3.3 grams DAP
If the pH drops below 3.3, add Potassium Carbonate (0.25 – 0.5 tsp). Test and bring up the pH to about 3.45. The mead should be done fermenting in about 3 weeks. When fermentation is complete, add 1 Madagascar Vanilla Bean and 3 Saigon/Vietnamese Cinnamon sticks. Let sit for about 1 week – tasting every few days.  When flavor is at a pleasant level to you, remove the vanilla bean and cinnamon sticks. Rack to a new carboy and fine using Super Clear or other fining agent. If bottling, add potassium sorbate/potassium meta-bisulfite to stabilize.  If kegging this isn’t needed.",

In early May 2008, Charlie Papazian, along with his wife and close friends, ventured out to London to fulfill a desire to taste very old mead. Charlie and company were lucky enough to try some meads from 1947, 1948, and 1949. The seventh mead he tried on his mead-journey was a 1949 Gulval Bochet, which he noted had no sediment or indications that fruit had been used in the recipe, so it must've been 100-percent honey mead. And that it was!
The deep copper color and vanilla-like aroma were accompanied by a well-integrated, toffee-textured, sherry-like character. The group later discovered that bochet refers to ""burnt mead,"" which would explain the toffee-like character and deep color. As Charlie said, ""The three-day tasting experience was grueling, but someone had to do it.""","Ingredients:
18.5 lb. (8.2 kg) light honey
4 g yeast extract or appropriate amount of other yeast nutrient as recommended by your local homebrew supply shop

3 Tbsp. (40 g) dried Champagne or mead yeast (Prise de Mousse or other Champagne yeast is an excellent choice)
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.130–1.138
Final Gravity: 1.028–1.038

Add honey to a pot. Do not add water. Gently boil the honey until it has turned dark and tastes caramelized. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and zinc-fortified yeast, and blend into “scorched” honey. Add this hot honey and water mixture to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in your primary fermenter. Add more cold water as needed to achieve 5 gallons total volume. Aerate extremely well and add dissolved yeast nutrient (yeast extract). When temperature is below 80° F (26.5° C) add rehydrated yeast. Mead is best initially fermented between 70 and 75° F (21–24° C). Ferment until activity is very low; this may take three weeks to three months. Rack to secondary fermenter. Secondary can be stored at cooler temperatures. Rack off sediment after six months to a year. Bottle when clear and all fermentation has ceased. Cork in wine bottles for long-term aging. If using beer bottles or Champagne bottles that can accept bottle caps, dip capped bottle top in melted paraffin to inhibit air ingress into bottle. Best after 50 years, but worth indulging in when you and the mead are ready.",

“This was an experimental rescue mead. In general, however, here’s a description of the train wreck and subsequent rescue attempt. The mead stalled in primary. Despite adjusting the pH and pitching more yeast, it would not drop below about 1.060. The yeast was probably 71B, but I also re-pitched Champagne and others in a vain attempt to restart fermentation. At that point, I needed to empty my Flanders red barrel, so in went the mead for about six months just to see what would happen. It dropped some more points, but not much. The barrel gave it subtle oak, funky aromatics and some acidity.” Forced CO2 to carbonate (2.5 volumes).",

The entire mead making process for this recipe is covered in the Making Mead Start by placing the honey containers in a warm water bath to allow the honey to flow easily. Fill up a clean and sanitized primary fermenter half way with water. Add the honey and stir or shake until the honey is nearly fully dissolved. Add enough water to reach 5 gallons and mix or shake again until the honey is fully dissolved in the water. If the must (term for unfermented mead) appears to stratify after settling, keep on mixing! Next, take the time to conduct proper procedures to rehydrate dry yeast prior to pitching. Once rehydrated, pitch the yeast and nutrient into the must and seal the fermenter with an airlock. Hold fermentation in the range of 60-70°F (15.5-21°C), with lower temperatures being more favorable. Primary fermentation should be nearly complete after three weeks, at which point the mead can be racked to a secondary vessel for bulk aging. Once fermentation has ceased, bottle or keg the mead “still,” meaning no added carbonation.",

Submerse the honey containers in hot water to loosen the honey, which will make it easier to dissolve. Partially or totally thaw the fruit. Sanitize all equipment used for making your mead. Mash the bagged fruit with your hands. If you prefer, put all the fruit into the pail and mash with a potato masher or similar tool. Use enough honey and water to get a total volume of 4.5 to 5 gallons (excluding fruit). Honey weighs approximately 12 pounds per gallon. Put all the fruit into your fermenting pail. You will want the temperature of the mead must to be 65 to 70 °F. If the fruit is still very cold you should heat the water enough to bring the temperature of the must into that range. Add the honey and water to the pail. Use a mixing spoon or wine degasser to mix the must and completely dissolve the honey. After the honey is dissolved, stir vigorously for a few minutes to aerate the must. The must does not need heat to pasteurize the honey or fruit. Prepare your yeast by re-hydrating, following the instructions on the packets. The use of a re-hydration nutrient such as Go-Ferm is highly recommended. This will prepare the yeast for the strenuous journey ahead of them. Pitch the yeast, add the first SNA and mix well. Fermentation should begin in about 12 to 24 hours. When signs of fermentation are noticed, start managing the fruit cap and begin the SNA schedule. With some luck, fermentation will be complete in two to four weeks. Once half of the sugar is depleted, continue to punch the cap at least twice a day but refrain from introducing oxygen into the must. Allow the mead to stay in primary for 4 weeks. At that point, transfer to the secondary carboy for clarifying. Taste the mead for sweetness level. If you desire more sweetness, now is the time to adjust it. To sweeten mead, start with a cup of the mead and add honey to a level sweeter than you want. Then blend the dryer mead with the sweetened sample to get three samples that vary by 10 gravity points ranging from too sweet to not sweet enough. Taste and blend the samples until you get the sweetness level you want. Get some help with this as your palate may get fatigued. Take a gravity reading of the sample you chose. Determine the specific gravity difference between the mead and the sample. Now you can figure out how much honey you will need to sweeten the entire batch to the desired level. One pound of honey will raise one gallon of mead approximately 34 gravity points. If you have 5 gallons of mead, each pound of honey will raise the batch about 6 to 7 points. Once you determine how much honey you need to add to the batch, use 1 cup of boiled water per pound of honey to dilute the honey. Pour the mixture into the carboy and mix until evenly dispersed. Take a sample and see if further adjustment is needed. Take caution to keep from over-sweetening the batch. It’s much harder to make it drier! After a month or two if the mead is not clear, transfer again and use a two-stage clarifier such as Super-Kleer. You can also use relatively inexpensive plastic filters with filter pads, pumping the mead from one keg, through the filer to a second keg. You will be amazed by the amount of fruit debris and insect parts on the filter pads, but your mead should be sparkling clear. One word of caution when filtering, pectin will clog a filter very quickly. You can use pectic enzyme to help remove the pectin. Two stage clarifiers do not remove pectin. Once you are completely sure there is no fermentation and the mead is clear, you can bottle. For sparkling mead, I suggest kegging and force carbonating. Bottle-conditioning sweet mead can be difficult, as well as creating exploding bottles.
Staggered Nutrient Addition (SNA)
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix immediately after pitching yeast.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix 24 hours after fermentation begins.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix 48 hours after fermentation begins.
Add ¾ teaspoon yeast energizer/nutrient mix after 30% of the sugar has been depleted.
SNA serves many purposes for yeast health. Abundant CO2 is toxic to yeast, so mixing while adding the nutrients will release the gas. Vigorous mixing introduces oxygen needed by growing yeast. The mixing also disturbs the fruit cap (or floating fruit). Punching down the cap should be done at least three times a day during the period of vigorous fermentation. Cap management is important for releasing toxic CO2 and preventing temperature buildup below the cap. For every 1 degree reduction of brix in the must, there is approximately a 2°F increase in temperature. Unmanaged, the temperature can increase to the point of killing your yeast in the heat zone below the cap, potentially driving off the floral fruity character of your fruit. This is less of a concern in the five gallon homebrew scenario but could still be a potential problem. If the cap is not pressed down into the must it can dry out. Then, if oxygen is introduced, spoilage organisms grow and produce off flavors.","Traditional Option
Making a melomel with nearly 20 pounds of fruit can get pricy! As a cheaper alternative, forgo the fruit and juice to create a traditional mead consisting purely of honey, water and yeast. Yeast nutrients and the SNA schedule should still be followed for optimum fermentation. Take into consideration that forgoing the fruit and juice will alter specifications listed above.

Original Gravity: 1.145","Directions:
Wash the ginger with tap water. Do not bother peeling the ginger; a food processor is your best bet to slice it up. Place the ginger in a sanitized mesh bag. Boil the bag for a few minutes to sanitize it since some chemical sanitizers are not effective on fabrics and the sanitizers can be hard to rinse out of the fabric.
Pour the honey into a large plastic fermenter. Start adding water to the fermenter. After just a couple of gallons, start stirring the mixture. Once you have a couple gallons of water and the honey mixed together, place a sanitized hydrometer in the must. Slowly add water and mix after each addition until you hit the target OG. Add 0.25 teaspoons of Fermaid K and 0.5 teaspoons of diammonium phosphate to the fermenter.
Once you have the must mixed up, rehydrate the yeast in GoFerm, following the package directions. Once rehydration is complete, mix the rehydrated yeast and liquid into the fermenter.
Once or twice a day, stir the must and push the bag of ginger back under the liquid. The stirring process will release a lot of CO2 from the must. Stir until almost no more bubbles are released by additional stirring. If stirring with a spoon, it will take a while to drive out all the CO2. Using a wand in the drill is faster, but be careful not to release so much CO2 so fast that the fermenter foams over the top.
Once a day, after a round of stirring, add the dose of nutrients, 0.25 teaspoons of Fermaid K and 0.5 teaspoons of diammonium phosphate. Do this for 3 days.
After three to four weeks, rack the mead into glass and wait for it to drop clear. Use Super-Kleer K.C. to help clarification if the mead has finished fermenting. Once clear, keg and carbonate to around 3 volumes of CO2.",

I also added 3 g of Fermaid K and 6 g of DAP yeast nutrients on the first day as well. Ferment at about 62°F (17°C). When fermentation was over, I racked, cold crashed, and aged the cider for several months. I kegged, force carbonated, and bottled. This cider should age well for several years if packaged and stored properly.",

Fermented in the 58°F–62°F (14–17°C) range, chilled to stop fermentation early, and a couple years later I got around to force carbonating it. Golden Russet chosen for very high gravity and arguably my favorite apple. Northern Spy for high acid and fruit character, often pear/melon. McIntosh is sometimes described as tasting like partially fermented apples, and usually retains a noticeable “mac note” after fermentation. This fills the “tastes like apples” character many judges seem to look for. Cote des Blancs can be reliably stopped with cold temperatures but is prone to hydrogen sulfide production if it isn’t happy. For inexperienced cidermakers, I’d recommend a Champagne yeast, ferment dry, stabilize, back-sweeten, and force-carb. It’s quite acidic already, so I keep carbonation fairly low. If your juice isn’t high enough gravity, try partially freeze-concentrating it. 1.045 juice ain’t gonna get ya there…",

Others profess to produce a cherry cider, but none begin with 100% sour Granny Smith apples (eschewing all other apple varieties for their lack of sourness) unified with the superior Montmorency sour cherry (aka Prunus cerasus, a superior and vastly dissimilar cherry to Prunus avid, the bird cherry, the mere mazzard, so commonly used in cough syrup and children’s sweet-snacks) and the exotic Morello sour cherry (hailing from my native country of Hungary), fermented with an English Ale yeast (procured from a fine brewery in Chiswick, London), rounded out with a spot of Bartlett pear juice (undeniably the world’s greatest pear-flavored pear) and completed with a touch of spiciness (largely attributable to the ghost chili pepper, although married with a secret spice), precisely enough to make your vigor race and spirits embrace another gulp. This is a cherry cider like none you have ever tasted.","Ingredients:
JUICE
4 gal. (15.1 L) super-tart apple juice, Granny Smith if possible
1 gal. (3.8 L) tart cherry juice
YEAST
Wyeast 1968 London ESB YEAST
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
Fermaid K
Super Kleer
10–15 cloves
Dried chiles of your choice
Specifications:
Yield: 5 US gal
ABV: 6%","Directions:
Ferment the apple juice at 62–72°F (17–22°C). Don’t let it climb above 72°F (22°C).
Add yeast nutrient—use Fermaid K, not plain old diammonium phosphate (DAP)—at 30–35% attenuation according to the dosage on the package, noting that the juice will go full dry, down to below 1.000 SG (0°P).
When fully dry, let the cider age in primary for 3 weeks. Chill, if possible, to help the yeast drop out of suspension. After 3 weeks, add Super Kleer according to the manufacturer’s instructions to clarify, and then transfer off the Super Kleer to a secondary container.
Add 1 gal. (3.8 L) of tart/sour cherry juice. Do not use “dark/sweet” cherry juice. It may be hard to find this product, but I can usually get it at Whole Foods Market. It can be much pricier than sweet juice. Look for Montmorency and/or Morello varieties. These are tart pie cherries, which are largely inedible.
Prepare clove tea by adding 10–15 cloves to a small pot with 3 cups (710 mL) of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 1 hour. Strain out the cloves and cool the tea (adding ice is OK). Add a quarter cup of the tea to the cider to start, and then, using ESP, stop adding the tea just before you begin to actually taste the clove in the final blended cider.
Make a tincture by soaking a couple of dried chiles in vodka for 1–3 weeks. Ghost chiles are great, as are habaneros. The hotter, the better. Be careful with this tincture! Do not use fresh chiles, as they will give a vegetal flavor and aroma. Depending on the Scoville intensity of the liquor, add an amount that produces an ever-so-slight hint of heat. It’s very easy to overdo it. Maybe get a friend to help taste it with you.",

Fire cider is similar to ice cider and is sometimes produced by the same cideries in Quebec. The goal is to concentrate the juice, but instead of freezing and thawing, it is concentrated by boiling. The method is similar to maple syrup production, but it’s much more manageable since the starting gravity of apple juice is higher than that of maple sap. Apples like Spartan, Cortland, and McIntosh are traditionally used in Quebec’s ice- and fire-cider production.
First, I pressed 90 lb. of apples to yield 6 gallons of juice at 1.065 (15.9°Bx) starting gravity. I then placed this juice into a pot on a gas stove, slowly brought it to a boil, and continued boiling on low heat. It took approximately 4.5 hours to boil down from 6 gallons to 2.5 gallons with a gravity of about 1.160 (36.2°Bx). The concentrated juice was left overnight to chill to room temperature.
At this point, I added the 3 tsp. pectic enzymes and divided the 2.5 gal. into two batches of 1.25 gal. each, which I fermented at 60˚F (16˚C) with DV10 (Champagne) and 71B-1122 (Narbonne) yeasts. I added 2 tsp. Fermaid O to each batch on the first day, and fermentation took approximately 4 weeks. The 71B batch finished at 1.080 (19.3°Bx), while the DV10 batch finished at 1.073 (17.7°Bx).
After aging the ciders for two years, I re-assessed both batches. The 71B batch turned out fruitier (estery), while the DV10 batch turned out more apply (neutral fermentation). After playing with blends, I settled on a straight 50/50 ratio, which yielded the best profile. The finishing gravity of the blended cider was approximately 1.077 (18.7°Bx) with 11% ABV. Ciders were clarified with Super-Kleer K.C. and blended before bottling. This cider can be bottle conditioned. The oldest commercial fire cider I’ve seen was 11 years old.",

Clean all equipment and apples thoroughly before pressing and press directly into the sanitized primary fermentation vessel. Save 1/2 gal. (1.89 L) of juice and freeze it to use for blending to your desired sweetness level after the secondary maturation time. Pull 1 cup (237 mL) of juice, and dissolve both the Fermaid K and pectic enzyme in it before adding the solution back into the fermenter. Natural fermentation should take off after a couple of days, after which allow the cider to continue fermenting in the primary vessel for 2 months at 62°F (17°C). After two months, rack the cider into a secondary vessel. Purge the secondary vessel of oxygen before racking; a keg will work well for this purpose. Allow the cider to mature for an additional 5 months at 66°F (19°C) After the additional maturation time and carbonation, the resulting cider will be quite dry. Use a small syringe and the previously frozen apple juice to back sweeten to taste in sample glasses. This cider is semi-dry and uses roughly 11.5 oz. (340 mL) of fermented cider to 0.5 oz. (15 mL) of juice. Blend at packaging to your chosen ratio by adding the juice to a sanitized bottle, then filling the remaining volume with cider using a counter-pressure bottle filler. Force carbonate with CO2 to 1.8 vol. (3.6 g/L), which is pétillant. When all the bottles have been capped, heat pasteurize by heating a kettle of water to 180°F (82°C) and gently placing bottles in the kettle, making sure the water line is at or just below the fill level of the bottles. Turn off the heat, and let the bottles sit for 10 minutes before removing them and letting them return to room temperature. Repeat this process until all bottles are pasteurized, and then store in a cool location.",

This is a blend of Michael’s high-gravity, high-acid New World cider featuring a high percentage of Golden Russet, Northern Spy, Liberty, McIntosh, and crabapples. It’s 9.5% ABV and off-dry, with Amy’s fantastic version of Ken Schramm’s Falls Bounty Cyser fermented dry from The Compleat Meadmaker. New England Cider needs an adjunct sugar character, and Fall’s Bounty happens to use just the sort the style needs. The last couple points of sugar to achieve medium sweetness were from back-sweetening with Michael’s Ice Cider. A small amount of medium toast American oak will add tannin, but don’t overdo it. The cider can be made in one recipe, but blending is a passion of both creators and an easy way to tweak things. The amount necessary of the cider and cyser blend will depend on the levels of sweetness fo the two components and strength of adjunct character. NEC shoudn’t show high amounts of honey. This can handle some age, as mild oxidation will just tend to emphasize the molasses and raisin. The indicated original gravity assumes you try to make this without blending to hit the 11% ABV mark. We like it served still at a cool room temperature. Primary Fermentation: Several months at around 50°F (10°C).",

Kevin shared the following:
Our winning beer is year one of a multi-year 15-gallon Solera Gueuze project brewed by myself and my son, Noah. The beer itself is a golden yellow, funky, mildly sour Belgian Lambic wheat beer with balanced notes of lemon and Brett on a bready malt base.
A traditional Gueuze is a beer made by blending one-, two-, and three-year-old barrel-aged Gueuze to make a final product. Due to space limitations at my home, we have chosen to brew our beer using the Solera technique where we age 15 gallons in a barrel for a year, remove 5 gallons and blend 5 fresh gallons into the barrel mix, and then age that for another year and repeat the process until we have our 3-year aged blend.","Ingredients:

Note: This recipe is intended to produce 10 gallons of beer. Noah brewed five more gallons at the same time, so there was a total of 15 gallons brewed (give or take) to split into three 5-gallon batches, each with a different yeast.
Single infusion mash at 152°F (66.7°C) for 60 minutes with ~36.84 quarts of water. Batch sparge with 8 gallons of water. Pre-Boil volume (approx.): 13.31 gallons (50.4 L)
Boil for 60 minutes, following the boil additions as listed in the ingredients. At the end of the boil, chill to fermentation temperatures as specified by the yeast packets (bug inoculations).
Separate the wort equally among three 5-gallon buckets. Pitch one yeast packet into each bucket (Wyeast 5526, 3278, and 5335). Ferment at room temperature for 14 days. We chose the kitchen to have the warmest spot in the house to develop the beer the way we wanted.
After the batches were fermented, we racked them into a used bourbon barrel that I had lying about that had already been souring on the last batch aged. There was no residual bourbon character in the barrel. The barrel sits in the lower level of my home which stays around 60-65°F (15.6-18.3°C) year-round.
After racking the 15 gallons (56.8 L) of Gueuze into the barrel, there was headspace in the barrel. We decided to let it ride to develop a pellicle for additional natural complexity… which it did.
We aged the barrel for an entire year before opening it to taste it. At around the one-year point, we brewed a new 5-gallon (18.9 L) batch of the base Gueuze and fermented it with one of the bug inoculations we previously used.
For the Solera project, we racked 5 gallons of the one-year aged beer from the barrel and racked the 5 gallons of fresh Gueuze in. After that ages for a year, we will have, theoretically, 10 gallons of 2-year aged Gueuze in the barrel blended with 5 gallons of one-year aged Gueuze. And, the project continues…
The 5 gallons of one-year aged Gueuze for 2023 was bottled with fresh yeast and corn sugar to create our entry for the competition.",

American cream ale is a great beer style for those just getting their feet wet in tasting craft beer.
With faint malt notes and little to no hop aroma, it is similar to the ubiquitous American light lager. Like most ales, we'll ferment this between 65° F and 70° F for a crisp, light-bodied beer. Though cream ale is considered an ale by style guidelines, it is not uncommon to use lager yeast in brewing this style. This particular recipe is known to have a slightly more elevated hop flavor than traditional cream ales, with some fruitiness and sweet corn notes.
This recipe was created and brewed by Chris ""Pacman"" Ingermann of BrewRats homebrew club in Muncie, Ind. It took home a gold medal in the 2002 National Homebrew Competition.","Ingredients:
