This partial mash blonde ale recipe from Chris Colby is lighter in color and drier than could be made with malt extract alone. The beer is not meant to be the driest or lightest possible, but simply on that end of the spectrum. (For an even drier, lighter beer, swap sucrose for some of the malt extract.) Use fresh malts and malt extract—and pay extra attention to cleaning and sanitation—to get the best bready malt character balanced by the hop aromatics.

Final Gravity: 1.010 (2.6°P)
ABV: 4.5%
IBU: 21
SRM: 6-7","Directions:
Make yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. In your brew pot, heat 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) brewing liquor to 161°F (72°C). Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and submerge in brew pot. Mash at 150°F (66°C) for 45 minutes, stirring and heating briefly every 10 minutes to maintain the mash temperature. In a separate pot, heat 5 qt. (4.7 L) water to 170°F (77°C).
When the mash is done, do not conduct a mash-out step. Lift bag above brew pot and let it drip until you can move the bag of grain to a 2-gallon beverage cooler without splattering too much. Scoop or pour the wort from the brew pot into the cooler. Recirculate the wort until it clears a bit, then run off.
Sparge steadily over 60 minutes. To do so, collect about a cup (250 mL) of wort from the cooler every 90 seconds, then add the same volume of hot water to the top of the grain bed. Once you have collected about 10 qt. (9.5 L), add roughly half of the malt extract to your brew pot, and let the wort dissolve it. Once the extract is completely dissolved, hold the temperature near 150°F (66°C) as you collect the rest of the wort. Add about 2 qt. (1.9 L) of water to the brew pot to yield about 3.5 gal. (13.3 L) when you’re done collecting the wort.
Bring wort to a boil. If hot break does not appear big and fluffy after 5 minutes, add 0.5 tsp. calcium chloride. Add the bittering hops and boil wort for an additional 55 minutes. Add Irish moss with 20 minutes left in the boil. Don’t let boil volume dip below 3 gal. (11.4 L) during boil. Add boiling water to top up, if needed. Stir in the remaining malt extract in the last 10 minutes of the boil.
Chill wort to 68°F (20°C), rack wort to a fermenter, and add water to yield about 5 gal. (18.9 L). Aerate the wort thoroughly and pitch sediment from the decanted yeast starter. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). After fermentation stops, rack to a secondary fermenter and hold for three days. Fine with PVPP for clarity, if desired (see below), before racking beer to keg or bottling bucket. Carbonate to 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) of CO₂.
FOR CLEARER BEER (OPTIONAL):
After fermentation and conditioning, dissolve 8 g PVPP in roughly 2 fl. oz. (60 mL) of hot water and gently stir into top layer of beer. Let settle overnight, then rack beer to keg or bottling bucket.",

Chris Colby shares this homebrew recipe for a strong dark ale with a moderately roasty character. It is reasonably dry considering its high original gravity, and the malt, hops, alcohol, and roast character are all in balance. It is meant to seem like an English ale, but it is not an attempt to clone any commercial brand or mimic any classic beer style. For best results, make an appropriately sized yeast starter so you are pitching actively fermenting yeast, and hold the fermentation temperature as constant as you can manage. If you can’t find fresh Goldings, feel free to use any other English hop variety you like.","Ingredients:

Big Brew 2023: Old school rules!
We homebrewers are a promiscuous lot, pushing boundaries and trying new fermentations that are adventurous, unique, and sometimes even wacky. We scan the aisles for inspiration and come up with unique beverages. Some of us never attempt to brew the same recipe twice, and that’s OK.
When I started brewing almost 30 years ago, a friend suggested that I should clone a beer I loved several times until I could repeat it faithfully. This began my initial quest to clone Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale (SNPA), which in turn begot my Nearly Nirvana Pale Ale (NNPA.)
More than 40 years ago, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. set out to create a new American style, the American pale ale. Once considered crazy hoppy, it fortunately wasn’t too far ahead of its time. Ken Grossman, founder of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., states that “after 42 years Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (SNPA) still resonates as a favorite with brewers and drinkers at all levels. Pale Ale started out in 1980 as an anomaly in a world dominated by light lagers with a hop-forward yet balanced style. After all these years it still holds its own in a world now accustomed to a nearly limitless range of hop-forward styles, many that can trace their roots back to the original Sierra Pale Ale.”
In 2000, a call went out to AHA members for an SNPA homebrew recipe and my Nearly Nirvana Pale Ale (NNPA) was shared with the community for that year’s Big Brew recipe. So why bring back this one for Big Brew 2023? Read on and learn…
Oscar Wilde once said that “consistency is the hallmark of the unimaginative.” I counter this philosophy and believe that to master brewing, one must start with a thorough understanding of one’s processes, systems, and ingredients, as well as one’s own limitations to achieve the desired outcomes.
I have brewed my NNPA more than 90 times because my friends and I love it. With my multiple iterations, I began a journey of discovery, tweaking the recipe one variable at a time to understand the impact. Change a mash temperature here, base or specialty grain there, water-to-grain ratio, yeast strain or amount, fermentation temperatures, and so on. By keeping all but one variable the same, I was able to truly understand its impact.
Along with NNPA’s deliciousness, its beauty lies in its simplicity. My current iteration of NNPA is a tad more malt and hop forward than SNPA, and just a skosh bigger. The recipe has been tweaked many times over the years, but my current iteration is, to me, Goldilocks—just right. 
The Homebrew Recipe
Two grains, one hop varietal, and single infusion: easy peasy! Start with fresh American pale malt, add a touch of crystal 40, and mash in at around 156–158°F (69–70°C) to obtain that malt balance. Add an ounce of Cascade whole hops (hey, we are talking old school here) at 75, 60, 15, and 5 minutes before the end of the boil. Add your favorite American ale yeast strain. After a couple of weeks, enjoy. Something not up to what you seek? Examine your process, ingredients, and system and try again, tweaking one variable at a time.
I state that one needs 11.5 pounds of grain for a 5-gallon batch to achieve an original gravity of 1.060. This is, of course, based on one’s system efficiency. Mine gets 72 percent. This is another teachable point about knowing your system. Do you consistently add 1.25 quarts per of grain? Or perhaps 1.5? I prefer closer to 1.5 and only use less water per pound of grains when trying to stuff a large amount of grain into my mash for a barleywine, Belgian tripel, or other high-gravity beer. Your mileage may vary.
Similarly, I suggest 4 ounces of whole Cascade hops at various times for this recipe. The most recent cones I obtained were 5.5% alpha acids, but I have seen Cascade pellets with more than 8%. I am targeting mid-40 IBUs, with the bulk of these in the bittering additions. I also suggest boiling for 75 minutes with additions at 75 and 60 minutes. Time is never an issue when I brew, but there is no reason you couldn’t add them together at 60 minutes. And if you want to lower the bitterness, just add one ounce at 60 minutes and skip the 75-minute addition. When I started brewing, well, sonny, we didn’t know about whirlpool hops (old fogy mode off), so feel free to add that last ounce of hops to your whirlpool if you like.
The point is if you are going to try a recipe multiple times, be consistent with your process. Stick to your standard operating procedure before you go changing anything; after you have developed it into something repeatable and it has virtually become muscle memory, you can tweak it as you like. Hey, you are taking careful notes, aren’t you?
Water is an intimidating subject, and several excellent water calculators are available. If you don’t have an analysis of your water supply, suggesting water additions is somewhat meaningless. Early on someone suggested adding a teaspoon of gypsum (calcium sulfate) to the boil for 5 gallons of hoppy pale ale. This dries the finish, accentuates the bitterness, and tamps down harshness and other benefits, so I do this at a minimum, but my water sources have typically been very soft.
I have used a variety of American and English ale yeasts over the years, but I find a neutral American ale yeast works best—for me. I have brewed split batches to try two or three different yeast strains to understand their differences. Splitting a batch is easy and ensures all other variables are consistent.
If you are like many adventurous homebrewers who veer toward the untried, the unique, the one-off, I applaud your daring, your audacity, and your courage. If you brew without a fully formed recipe in your mind and just wing it, ask yourself if you could brew this masterpiece again if you wanted to. Or have you had your share of messterpieces?
I urge you to consider selecting an easy recipe for a beer style you love. By selecting a proven craft beer that you spend your hard-earned shekels on, or a homebrew recipe that you love, you can enjoy the fruits of your labor while you tinker and learn. Find your recipe, nail it down, and then play with a single variable. You then become viscerally aware of the impact that one variable makes. We can read all we like about ingredients and processes, but by experiencing the entirety of the aromas, flavors, and other dynamics of your finished brew that a single change makes, you are on the road to becoming a better brewer.

Once the extract is dissolved, bring the liquid to a boil. Follow the hop addition schedule listed in the ingredients. Note that the timing of hops is from the end of the boil. Ex: This recipe calls for a 60-minute boil, so the 60-minute addition of hops are added as soon as the boil begins.
After 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add in the 0-minute hop addition. Chill your wort down below 70° F (21° C), transfer to a fermenter, and pitch the yeast. Ferment in the temperature range called for by the yeast you use.
When fermentation is complete (typically ~2 weeks), bottle condition using the corn sugar listed in the ingredients to “bottle condition” (carbonate) your beer. After another ~2 weeks in bottles, you’re good to taste your homebrew!
*Note: this recipe aims to produce ~1.5 gallons of wort at the end of the boil. Depending on your heat source, you will need to start with more water or top up in the fermenter!

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/star-gazer-hazy-double-ipa-big-brew-2021/,Not Found,"This hazy double IPA was formulated to showcase the tropical and juicy aromas from BSG Hops’ Zamba™ blend and the minty and green-apple aroma notes from German Polaris hops. The grist is typical for the style, with a little boost from sucrose to increase wort gravity without adding non-fermentables or additional malt flavor. The hopping schedule and yeast strain are intended to set the stage for aroma retention and biotransformation while keeping hop bitterness in check.
Recipe creator Ashton Lewis says, “The name is also a bit odd and was inspired by the recent Great Conjunction and the use of North Star Pils ™ malt and Polaris (a.k.a. the North Star) hops.”

Dark Inception Imperial Porter was contributed by Marcus Baskerville of San Antonio’s Weathered Souls Brewing Co., and the leading force behind the Black Is Beautiful collaborative brewing project.
This recipe was inspired by 2013 AHA Homebrewer of the Year Annie Johnson. Seeing an African American woman win Homebrewer of the Year provided Marcus with a bright hope for his future in homebrewing and inspired his love of brewing big dark beers.
Dark Inception Imperial Porter is a thick-bodied, flavorful beer that features additions of raspberry, cacao, and vanilla, and is bursting with notes of toffee, caramel, coffee, chocolate, malt, liqueur, and fruit. It’s a perfect pairing with rich desserts or as a standalone finale for your evening.

2 Liters Boiron Raspberry Puree
7.8 oz (221 g) Cacao Nibs
2 Madagascar Vanilla Beans to be soaked in Bourbon for 1 week (or 2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract)
1 Tbsp Fermax Yeast Nutrient (optional if your yeast is fresh)

Original Gravity: 1.085 (20.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.023 (5.83°P)
ABV: 8.4%
IBU: 20
SRM: 40","Directions:
Bring 1 gallon (3.8L) of water to 175°F (80°C). Place grains in a strainer bag, and add to water, making sure that they are completely saturated. Steep grain for 30 minutes at approximately 165°F (74°C), stirring occasionally. Remove, rinse, and top off kettle to your normal boil volume.
Stir in the 4 lbs of DME, making sure that it is completely dissolved, then bring to a boil. Total boil time will be 60-90 minutes (depending on desired level of caramelization and desired OG). 30 minutes after reaching boil, add the 60-minute hop addition.
With 15 minutes of the boil remaining, turn off burner. Stir in the 6.6 lbs of LME, 1 lb Maltodextrin, and 1½ tsp Yeast Nutrient, ensuring that they are completely dissolved before turning burner back on. Once having reached boil again, add second hop addition and complete the final 15 minutes of boil.
Chill to 70°F (21°C). Transfer to fermenter, top off volume with water if necessary, and sprinkle yeast directly into wort.
Fermentation Steps:
Once you’ve pitched the yeast, you can create the vanilla bean tincture. Slice the two vanilla beans lengthwise, and place in a pint-sized canning jar. Add 1 cup (235 ml) of your preferred bourbon. Seal jar, set aside, and allow the beans to macerate (soak) for at least a week, shaking jar occasionally. The vanilla beans will be added to the fermenter 1 week before packaging (2 Tbsp of Pure Vanilla Extract can be substituted in place of the vanilla beans just before bottling or kegging).
Ferment at 64-72°F (18-22°C) for 14-21 days.
On 6th day of fermentation: Add 1½ tsp Yeast Nutrient, and 2 Liters of fruit puree to your fermenter. Gently swirl fermenter, if possible, to rouse yeast.
1 week before kegging or bottling: Pre-heat your oven to 300°F. Line a cookie sheet with foil or parchment paper and spread the cacao nibs out evenly in a single layer. Place sheet on middle rack and bake for 10-12 minutes until aroma is released from cacao. Remove, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Place vanilla beans and cacao nibs in muslin bag, add to fermenter, and infuse for 7 days before packaging (if using vanilla extract add it just before packaging).","All Grain Version
Replace malt extract and specialty grains with:
11.5 lbs Crisp Finest Maris Otter
2.25 lb Weyermann® Munich Type 2 10°L
1.5 lb Simpsons DRC™ Double Roasted Crystal 105-120°L
0.75 lb Simpsons Chocolate Malt 400-500°L
0.25 lb Simpsons Black Malt 550-700°L
0.13 lb Weyermann® Chocolate Wheat Malt 375-450°L
Please note that grain bill is calculated for a brewhouse efficiency of 65%, adjust as needed. Mash at 151°F (66°C) for 75 minutes. Marcus recommends a 180-minute boil for the all-grain version of this recipe, but a 90-minute boil may be sufficient."
https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/cherry-chica-stout-with-julia-herz/,Not Found,"American Homebrewers Association (AHA) Executive Director Julia Herz shares the story behind her homebrew recipe, Cherry Chica Stout.
What’s the story behind this homebrew recipe?
I constructed Cherry Chica Stout in the 90s with the co-owner of the former What’s Brewing Homebrew Shop in Boulder, Colorado. I walked into the store looking to brew a unique stout with fruit, and co-owner Paul Gatza wrote out this recipe for me. Fun fact: Paul would go on to be AHA Director and is now Senior Vice President of the Brewers Association Professional Division.
I’ve since homebrewed this recipe many times, earning 1st place in 1998 and 2000 in the Hop Barley and the Alers Reggale & Dredhop Competition. The Alers are my Boulder-based homebrew club that AHA Founder Charlie Papazian helped create, so it’s fun to think of this recipe having had contact with so many past AHA Directors.
Fast forward to today in 2022. I brewed 7 barrels of Cherry Chica with Shawnee Adelson (Executive Director, Colorado Brewers Guild) and Marni Wahlquist (Head Brewer, Odell Brewing – Sloane Lake). It will be served at the Colorado Brewer’s Guild Collaboration Fest (April 2nd) and Odell’s Sloan Lake location.
Getting to brew this stout recipe on a pro system was a dream for this homebrewer!
What can homebrewers expect from the finished beer?
This beer has notes of roast, medium-low bitter, medium-high tannins that bring some grip, medium body, and a tart puckering sour pie cherry punch. Considering the 7% (estimated) ABV, it drinks relatively light, with the carbonation helping dry out the beer finish. I particularly love the tan collar of foam from the roasted barley and the dark, opaque nature of the beer’s color, with rust-colored hues.
If you find the beer is too tart for your liking, dropping a maraschino cherry into the glass of a fresh pour can work wonders. I now brew this stout recipe with 7-8 pounds of cherries, down from 10 pounds of the original recipe.
Please homebrew this beer, and you are guaranteed to impress when pairing this cherry stout with crumbled blue cheese and raspberry preserves on rice crackers. Duck with cherry sauce and cherry cheesecake are other all-star pairings.","Ingredients:

Why did you pick this homebrew recipe?
My husband, Matt, and I got into homebrewing in 2007. We bought Brewing Classic Stylesbased on the recommendation from the American Brewmaster homebrew shop, which helped us brew a few solid batches of extract beer.
I was still learning about beer and styles, so when I picked my first recipe, I based it on what I knew I liked at the time: wheat beers, Belgian-style whites, etc. In reading the book’s description of the saison recipe, I thought, “sure, why not!”
The finished product was delicious. I was sold on saison.
I remember it being refreshing, with flavors I had never experienced. There was a touch of spice balanced sweet. And it definitely was not like those offensive IPAs I had no desire for (at the time!).
This saison recipe made me fall in love with brewing, homebrewing, and beer.
Tell us about your homebrew club!
After relocating from North Carolina to beautiful Longmont, Colorado, I needed a way to make some new friends. I discovered Left Hand Brewing’s (Longmont, CO) Ales4Females program and went to a talk in December 2013 on beer tasting. The speaker–BJCP exam director Don Blake–mentioned he was a member of Longmont’s Indian Peak Alers homebrew club. My husband and I went to our first meeting in January 2014 and haven’t looked back since! Our homebrew club members are some of our dearest friends, becoming our family away from family.
I also brought my love of organizing and process improvement to the homebrew club. In 2016 I was elected Treasurer and ran our club’s annual homebrew competition, Peak-to-Peak Pro-Am. As I attended more events in the beer community, I looked for more opportunities to talk about beer, homebrewing, and our club. This love for community, connection, and diversity helped get me elected as Vice President of the Indian Peak Alers and then again in 2022 for 2 more years.
I am currently working on a project for Ales4Females where I interview women in the brewing industry in our club’s area of Boulder County to help advocate for more diversity in brewing. I want to make beer and brewing approachable to women and other marginalized folks.
Did we hear you have a portable brew rig?
Yes! I like to advocate that anyone can make beer at home. To help with this, I built a portable, brew-in-a-bag setup that I can take anywhere and brew. I just need access to freshwater!
I started doing homebrewing demonstrations at Longmont’s annual Oktoberfest to show how easy it is. If this little 5-foot tall woman can shlep all this equipment around and make beer under poor weather conditions (sometimes in the rain), anyone can do it!
The system comprises a converted keg, banjo burner, two 6-gallon buckets (one for fermentation), and a 50-foot copper immersion chiller. It all fits nicely into a wagon for easy transport from my vehicle to the demonstration site.
We still haven’t gotten our home brewery and walk-in cooler rebuilt in our new house, but I hope to host an inclusive brew day event with other marginalized folks in a driveway or patio soon!","Ingredients:

Why did you pick this homebrew recipe?
I picked this beer recipe because it’s always what I want: a little bitter, a little sweet; dry, but also fruity. The bright aromatics of grapefruit, orange, and pine reminds me of camping with my Dad.
My first beer love was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I know I’m not alone. It’s like your first crush and you’ll never forget it. When I first started homebrewing, this beer recipe from Brewing Classic Styles spoke to me. I return to it all the time. Easy, tasty, and classic.

A well-known beer style throughout history sometimes called an ‘English mild,’ the Dark Mild is typically low in alcohol while still medium-bodied due to increased dextrin malts. Expect roasty nuttiness with slight toffee notes perfect for the colder months. This recipe is a ripe example of the difference specialty malts can make.

Mark Pasquinelli shares the following about his beer recipe Mad About Saison:
My first stop [on my saison journey] was the world of Funky Town. I killed two birds with one stone on this recipe, getting out of the same-old-yeast rut and brewing something more sessionable than my usual 7.5% ABV saisons. I used a yeast blend made by Michael Tonsmeire, aka the Mad Fermentationist, that’s distributed through Bootleg Biology.
Tonsmeire mentioned that his yeast packs might swell during storage and not to be alarmed. His blend consists of saison yeast, wild Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, and an opportunistic Lactobacillus culture. At low temperatures, his blend is clean, while traditional saison temperatures bring out flavors of citrus, pepper, and clove.
The blend’s two pair well with fruity and tropical hops, so I did a hop stand and dry-hopped with Galaxy. As advertised, Galaxy’s repertoire of citrus, passion fruit, and grass nicely complement Tonsmeire’s yeast blend, mixing with its tart, crisp, citrus notes. The subsequent creation, Mad About Saison, was a big hit at two homebrew club meetings and became a personal after-dinner staple.","Ingredients:

My journey into homebrewing and the desire for different styles of beer started in the late 1970s. During a trip to Canada, I developed a liking for the draught version of Guinness that was brewed there and distributed widely.
Back home, my search for “different” beers mostly centered around trying regional lagers that were not distributed in our area. The fabled desire for Coors was epic, as it wasn’t to be found in Iowa. Our glee when Olympia and Stroh’s began local distribution! The brief fascination with malt liquor!
The occasional Harp, Heineken, and Carlsberg did offer some variation to the standard American lager fare. One could find other German imports if you were willing to pay the price and withstand the skunk associated with those products.
My real awakening with craft beer began with the opening of Front Street Brewery in Davenport, Iowa, in 1993. Their Raging River was my first experience with pale ale, and it was an eye opener for my beginning to understand the diverse styles of beer that existed in the world. Still, finding those styles in Davenport was limited.
I had heard that one could buy kits and make some of these different styles of beer at home, and I mentioned to my first wife that I was going to explore brewing beer. She beat me to it and surprised me with equipment and an ingredient kit for Christmas.
My early homebrews were stouts, brown ales, ambers, and reds. My second year, I brewed a pale ale. Around that time, I attended a live music event in downtown Rock Island, Ill., which is across the Mississippi River from Davenport. The usual suspect lagers were for sale on the plaza, so I ventured into Rock Island Brewing Co., which is not a brewery, but a pub and eatery named after a historical brewery in Rock Island.
The bartender, John Hovarth (who still pours beers at Radicle Effect Brewerks in Rock Island), commanded multiple taps, many of which poured craft beers from around the country that weren’t available in local stores. One he suggested was Bell’s Oberon. I asked about the style and was dumbfounded when he told me it was a wheat beer. My ignorance of beer styles was evident when I said, “I didn’t know they made beer from wheat.”
As the years passed, I tried my hand at crafting hefeweizen, dunkelweizen, and my favorite style, witbier, which I have brewed multiple times. In 2017, I brewed my first American wheat beer. Simple and straightforward, Summer Wheat has become my go-to summer beer.","Ingredients:

The following is an excerpt from the Zymurgy magazine article Brewing with Food: Oddities in the Mash Tun by Jonny Lieberman:
“Fellow [BeerAdvocate user] Neal Gauger from Philadelphia got in touch with me because he was coming to Los Angeles and wanted to collaborate on an East Coast meets West Coast beer. The West Coast part was easy: big and hoppy. But what to do about the East Coast angle? Specifically Philadelphia. Cheese steak? After some back and forth, Neal suggested Philly pretzels. A good choice, as they are mostly wheat and, compared to other pretzels, lightly salted. The only thing that troubled me is that Philly pretzels get soaked in lye prior to baking. Neal assured me it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“Since the pretzels had been baked, the starches would already be gelatinized. However, most of the starch would be inside the pretzels and protected from the enzymes by the hard outer crust. So, we tore 5 pounds of pretzels into little chunks. Unlike the pumpkin beer, where for whatever reason I was not worried about the stuck mash, I was worried about one with all those goopy pretzels. Because of my foolish pride, I again elected not to use rice hulls. But this time I was nervous. Those pretzels were quite gooey. To get around that, we mashed the beer at a thin 1/5 quarts per pound of grain. When it came time for the runoff, not only was it sooth and trouble free, but we achieved 83-percent efficiency. The final beer weighed in at 1.107 OG with an IBU load of 77.1. Flavor-wise, the pretzels contributed a fruity phenol similar to strawberries that was detected by some. All in all it was a very potent—and quaffable—DIPA (Double IPA).”","Ingredients:

Janet’s Brown Ale has quite the pedigree. Mike “Tasty” McDole took home a medal when this recipe won gold in the Brown Ale category in the National Homebrew Competition (NHC) in 2004. The award-winning recipe was then featured in Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer’s book, Brewing Classic Styles, as an example of a bigger, hoppier American Brown Ale. In 2009, McDole took gold again at the NHC with an updated recipe that he categorized as Imperial Brown Ale, but this time in the Specialty Beers category. Though Janet’s Brown Ale deviates a bit from the style guidelines for a traditional American Brown Ale, surely you will not be upset by the higher IBUs and ABV after taking a sip!

Add 2.9 oz of Lublin hops and allow to boil for the full 60 minutes. Be careful when adding hops as you may encounter a boil over during the first hop addition. With 15 minutes left in the boil add 1.0 oz of Lublin hops. Allow the wort to cool and then pitch the yeast around 53°F (12°C). Ferment around 53°F (12°C). When fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes of CO2.","All-Grain Option
Replace the Pilsener extract with 7 lb (3.17 kg) continental Pilsener malt. Replace the Munich extract with 12 lb (5.44 kg) Munich Malt. Mash at 150°F (66°C). Increase the pre-boil volume as needed to allow a 90 minute boil, which helps reduce DMS in the beer."

Danny Kiranos, aka Amigo the Devil, is a brewer by day and musician by night. From the Zymurgy magazine article:
Many of his homebrew creations, like the tobacco beer, are inspired by food and his culinary background. One of his all-time favorite homebrewers has been his Avacado Saison. ""I was really worried about the oil content, and I thought it would completely mess with the residuals,"" he says. He opted to cube the avocado, which was not too ripe and still pretty solid, smashing it ever so slightly. ""I figured that way the fat content wouldn't be so heavy,"" he explains. ""It just ferments out, and it dries out the beer a lot,"" he says. The result is an earthy, dry saison he loves.

They were a very new brewery at the time, so I also wanted to make something that would sell quickly. I decided to make something sour but not too crazy. So, I went home, brewed a kettle sour with wheat, and split it three ways to test different fruit additions.

Mash at 152° F (67° C) for one hour and sparge at room temperature. Once the temperature of the wort reaches 120° F (49° C), add the unmilled 2-row to inoculate with Lactobacillus. The original recipe calls for 3 days in an electric smoker at 120° F (49°C), but I leave it at room temperature (average of 85° F (29° C)) for 7-10 days. When the pH reaches 3.1-3.3, add the hops and boil wort for 15 minutes. Cool wort, transfer to a clean, sanitized carboy, and add hydrated yeast and raspberries. Leave the fruit for 4-6 weeks, depending on the color and level of activity. Prime with the table sugar, targeting 3 volumes of CO2. It usually carbonates in two weeks. Chill, pour and enjoy.","Partial-Mash Version

Will Cass started brewing in 2000 when he stumbled upon a Mr. Beer kit. Twenty years later Cass earned the Best of Show title at the 25th annual War of the Worts (2020), the Pennsylvannia-based competition organized by the Keystone Hops Homebrew Club in Montgomeryille, PA.
Cass share’s the following about his Solstice Stout recipe:
“I decided to make an American Stout last year as my December-to-January dark beer, since its dark, roasty, and chocolate notes pair well with all the holiday treats that infiltrate our home… I modeled the sensory profile after the description on a package of high-end coffee beans–highlight the roast, but with enough hop bitterness and citrus notes to complement and make sure it stays in the American stout realm.”

One-Ply Rye is based on an American IPA I’ve been brewing for a few years, but it’s a great one to brew now because the ingredients are so easily swapped to accommodate whatever you have on hand. No rye malt? Use more barley malt or sub in some wheat or oats. Caramel rye malt is readily replaced with any caramel malt in the 30–40°L range. And the world is your oyster when it comes to hops. When I first started brewing this, Amarillo hops were somewhat hard to come by, but they’re easy to get these days. I like the simplicity of dry yeast in a beer like this, but by all means, use what you’ve got.","Ingredients:

Homebrew Con was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead, Pangaea Proxima Polar IPA was selected as the 2020 Big Brew recipe, given that homebrewers from all over the globe would be brewing on May 2 and the recipe features ingredients from the Nothern and Souther Hemispheres.
“We want to use ingredients from all over the world to brew this beer. We decided to use the kveik yeast because what a dream that is for a homebrewer,” said Bailey Spaulding, who is a co-founder of Jackalope and will deliver the Keynote Address at Homebrew Con. “Then we landed on using New Zealand hops for the beer,” she continued, “so the yeast is from an area of the world near the North Pole, and the hops are from an area near the South Pole.”
The beer is named after Pangaea Proxima, which is a theorized future supercontinent that would form 300 million years in the future. “We thought it fit the idea well. Also, we really like the idea of bringing people from around the world together in a time when we are all so separate.”

Most of the hops we use for brewing are of the variety Humulus lupulus var. lupulus, but strains of H. lupulus var. neomexicanus, Medusa, has appeared in at least two commercial beers: Sierra Nevada's Harvest Wild Hop IPA and Crazy Mountain Brewing Company's Neomexicanus Native Pale Ale. And the experimental variety HBC 438, now known as Sabro, was made available to homebrewers in 2014.
Stone-Faced IPA is built around Medusa, but any variety of neomexicanus should work just as well and may be easier to source, Sabro in particular. The monks of the Benedictine Monastery of Christ in the Desert in New Mexico grow five other varieties—Chama, Latir, Tierra, Amalia, and Mintras—which have sold out quickly in the past, but more and more farms are devoting acreage to these uniquely North American varieties.","Ingredients:

Mill the malt and dough in, targeting a mash thickness of around 1.5 qt./lb., a temperature of 154°F (68°C), and a mash pH of 5.4. Hold the mash at 154°F (68°C) for one hour. Sparge slowly with 170°F (77°C) water and collect wort until the pre-boil volume is around 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Adjust this volume as needed to account for your boil-off rate. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first addition at the beginning of boil and the rest at 10 and 0 minutes before the end. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort to 50°F (10°C), aerate thoroughly, and pitch yeast. Ferment at around 50°F (10°C). With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in 2 weeks or less, but don’t rush it (cold-fermented lagers take longer than ales). If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation by raising fermentation temperature to around 60°F (16°C). Rack the beer to a secondary and lager for around 6 weeks. It was not common practice for brewers ca. 1900 to dry hop their lagers, but if desired, Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops could be added to secondary during lagering for additional noble hop aroma: 1 oz. (28 g) should be sufficient. Bottle or keg after lagering is complete.","Extract Version
Replace the malts with 7 lb. William’s Brewing American Lager liquid malt extract. Omit water salts. Dissolve extract in enough hot reverse osmosis or distilled water to yield a pre-boil volume of around 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Adjust this volume as needed to account for your boil-off rate. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.
Boil 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. The other hop additions are 10 and 0 minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill, pitch, and ferment as above."

The following homebrew recipe comes courtesy of Jared Hatch. Hatch designed this IPA to make use of some of the citrus fruits native to Korea.
As an avid cook, Hatch enjoys applying things he learns from the culinary world to his brewing. To extract the citrus flavors from the fruit without adding unwanted astringency and vegetal matter, he peeled 20 green tangerines from Jeju (an island off the south coast of Korea), put them in a zip-top bag with dextrose, and removed the air to keep the peels in close contact with the sugar to produce an “oleo-saccharum.” The peels dissolve the sugar and lend their essential oils in the process to yield a syrup that can be added to the boil kettle at knockout.","Ingredients:

A London porter benefits from the proper water: alkaline with a dose of sodium and chloride. Thames water was revered as producing better porters and that character is evidenced in the water profile. The somewhat elevated alkalinity of the London porter profile helps keep the mash pH slightly higher than in typical pale beer brewing, enhancing the flavor quality of the dark malts.
A London porter would likely be characterized as a brown porter using BJCP style guidelines. The malt bill for a brown porter is largely 2-row pale malt with modest percentages of roast and crystal malts. According to Brewing Classic Styles, the secret to a great brown porter recipe is the inclusion of brown malt. English hops are preferred to meld with the malt bill.","Ingredients:

Mash all malts in London porter water (adjust as necessary to produce a mash pH of 5.5 to 5.6) at a temperature between 150-154° F (65-68°C) for 60 minutes. A mashout step to 168° F (76° C) is helpful, but optional. Sparge the mash with low-alkalinity water that is acidified to a pH between 5.4 and 5.7. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Use a program such as Bru’n Water to guide the mineral additions needed to produce the London porter brewing liquor.

Heat collected wort to 85°C (185°F) and start whirlpool. Cool to 18–20°C (64–68°F) and run off into fermenter. Fermentation: Add 10% old Berliner weisse (pH < 3.5, minimum 2 months old) in fermenter; if not available, pre-acidify wort with lactic acid to a pH of 4.1–4.3. Pitch 19 mL of thick slurry from the mixed culture. Activate the yeast slurry 12 hours before with starter wort. Ferment at 20–25°C (68-77°F) for 2–3 months or until stable gravity is reached. Bottling: When bottling, use a mixture of old and young beer or, if not possible, priming sugar. Target an additional extract of 1.7°P (7 SG points). The result should be 3.5 vol. (7 g/L) of CO2. The beer should be kept at 18–20°C (64–68°F) for at least 3 weeks to develop the appropriate aroma and carbonation. Sensory Outcomes: In the beginning, the beer tastes and smells slightly lactic—a bit like grainy yogurt—but at around 4–8 weeks develops the typical bouquet of apricot and peaches. Later in bottling, it may develop a minimal funk that often manifests as hay-like aromas.","Extract Version
Due to the decoction mash and mash hopping technique, it is not possible to exactly reproduce this beer using extract. Nonetheless, you can still brew a delightful Berliner weisse by dissolving 4 lb. (1.81 kg) wheat liquid malt extract in hot water and then steeping the hops in the resultant wort for 30 minutes at 93°C (200°F). Chill wort to 18–20°C (64–68°F), transfer to fermenter, and proceed as above."

Erich Purcell, 2019 GABF Pro-Am Competition Bronze Medal, with Ross Koenigs of New Belgium Brewing Co.
Chess with Checkers is something Purcell calls a house beer that he brews fairly regularly. ""I love tripels, but I can't drink them the way I want to drink beer. So, I started pulling the recipe down to try to get it to a more quaffable strength, but still retain that Belgian flavor,"" he says.
He describes it as a Pilsner with a pile of Belgian flavor. ""It still has a hoppiness that you don't see in many belgian beers, but it's backed up by all of the esters an phenols that you do expect,"" he says.
That's exactly what stuck out to Ross Koenigs, research and development brewer at New Belgium Brewing Co., who said it's a beer that every brewer wahts to make and to drink. ""It was bright and crisp and had all the great Belgian character, but supremely drinkable and super well balanced,"" Koenigs says.

Joel Miller, 2019 GABF Pro-Am Competition Silver Medal, with Greg Fleehart of Precarious Beer Project.
Leicht is a beer that appeals to everyone, from the traditionally domestic beer drinkers to craft beer enthusiasts, Miller says. ""It's a beer basically for everybody,"" Miller notes. This could be attributed to the simple recipe with a little bit of body, some bittering hops, overall balance, and low alcohol.
Fleehart describes the beer as similar to a low-alcohol Munich helles, with flavors of a lightly toasted baguette. ""It's a really easy-drinking beer but with tons of flavor and texture,"" Fleehart says. ""The yeast has a really nice ester, more character than your average lager yeast.""

Zorn shared the following on his blog about the beer:
Earlier this year, I joined a great new group of coworkers on Capitol Hill. Within weeks, we had made plans to enter into the Capitol Hill Home-brew Competition, but weren't sure what to brew. In true democratic fashion, we setup to do an extensive tasting of styles to choose one that truly represents the people - or at least the handful of us in the office. While not unanimous, the group enjoyed citrusy new american hops and session strength. The natural choice was obvious - American Pale Ale.
But what to call this concoction? In a stroke of genius, we combined our Florida district connection (Manatees) with our committee assignments (Space) and voila The Majestic Sea Cow - Galaxy Hopped Pale Ale!

Rogue’s Chocolate Stout is smooth, sweet and velvety, and tastes like a chocolate malted milkshake with slight hoppiness and bittersweet chocolate notes.
The allure of this beer comes down to the chocolate flavors, which makes it enjoyable for both the chocolate and beer lover. The sweet, creamy head gives way to a rich chocolate truffle finish. This beer pairs perfectly with desserts as it’s balanced by plenty of roasty flavor and bitterness. We suggest pairing with a chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cream pie or other rich chocolate dessert.

Future Forward Sour Saison is a mixed-fermentation fruit beer inspired by my political engagement to a local Sato brewer in northeastern part of Thailand. Sato is a traditional sticky rice beer using a local yeast ball called Look Pang, which contains mold, mysterious yeast strains, and Lactobacillus, all of which give a nice fruity sour character to the brew.
Due to the hot climate of Thailand, this brew is designed for a high fermentation temperature using mixed yeast strains, saison yeast, and a Sato yeast ball. I also used lychee fruit from the northern hill tribes of Thailand. This recipe embraces the lost art of traditional Thai brewing.
I consider brewing to be an ancient human right. People should be able to make their own beer and bring happiness to share with their community. I am working on the laws here and looking forward to a future in which craft beer can be brewed in Thailand and later exported to the world.","Ingredients:

To prepare sticky rice:
Soak the sticky rice overnight.
Steam rice until cooked, about 15 minutes, then rinse with cool water until rice is cool and no longer sticky.
Mash grains and steamed sticky rice in 8 qt. (7.6 L) of water at 150°F (65.6°C). Collect the wort, top up with water to make 5 gal. (18.9 L), and bring to a boil. Top up to 6 gal. (22.7 L). Turn the heat off, add the malt extract and stir to completely dissolve. Return the wort to the heat and boil 60 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow to cool with the lid off until wort reaches 180°F (82.2°C). Add hops and blended lychee, and let steep 20–30 minutes before fully chilling. Transfer chilled wort to fermenter, aerate, and pitch the saison yeast and Sato yeast ball. Ferment at 73°F (22.8°C) for about two weeks. Add dry hops 7 days before bottling or kegging. * Sticky rice is also known as glutinous rice and can be purchased at any Asian market. Rice yeast balls are more difficult to find but can be ordered online from Amazon and eBay: search for “Chinese dried yeast balls.”",

Recipe courtesy Jackie O’s Pub & Brewery, Athens, Ohio
In May 2007, Art Oestrike’s brother Brian Oestrike summited Mount Everest to raise money for the LUNGevity Foundation, a lung cancer-focused nonprofit. Art and Brian’s mother, Jackie, had passed away from lung cancer on June 14, 2006. As Newcastle Brown Ale was a favorite of Jackie’s (who was born in England), then-brewer Brad Clark created the recipe for Chomolungma as an American interpretation of the British classic. The beer was named for the word Tibetans use for Mount Everest, which means “Goddess Mother of the Earth.” When it came time to choose the core lineup of beers to be released in cans from our production brewery in 2012–2013, this meant-to-be-one-off beer had become the third-best seller at our brewpub. It was first packaged in cans in May 2013 and has been a favorite of customers and staff alike ever since.","Ingredients:

Recipe by Roel Mulder
This traditional Dutch beer style was one of the many pleasant finds during my search for lost beer recipes. Its malty profile and unusual blend of spices make for a unique beer. Originally, it was made from 100 percent diastatic brown malt. To be on the safe side, I used a 50/50 blend of Munich malt and Pilsner malt here. If your Munich malt is light enough, and has enough diastatic power, you could try a 100 percent Munich malt grist.","Ingredients:
MALTS
4 lb. (1.81 kg) Munich malt
4 lb. (1.81 kg) Pilsner malt
HOPS
1.4 oz. (39 g) Hallertau (or similar) 4% a.a. @ 60 min
YEAST
2 sachets Fermentis SafAle S-33 or similar
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
0.9 oz. (26 g) crushed coriander seed @ 15 min
0.9 oz. (26 g) orange peel @ 15 min
0.9 oz. (26 g) licorice root @ 15 min
Specifications:
Yield: 4.89 gallons (18.5 L)
Original Gravity: 1.042 (10.5°P)
Final Gravity: 1.010 (2.6°P)
ABV: 4% by volume
IBU: 40
SRM: 8.6
Efficiency: 70%","Directions:
Mash at 152°F (66.7°C) for 60 minutes or until an iodine starch test indicates full conversion. (If you opt for 100 percent Munich malt, the lower diastatic power compared to other base malts may require extra time to complete saccharification.) Lauter, sparge, and collect wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops, coriander, orange peel, and licorice root as indicated. Chill to 63°F (17.2°C), pitch yeast, and ferment at that temperature until specific gravity stabilizes at or near 1.010 (2.6°P). Bottle or keg with 2.6 vol. (5.2 g/L) CO2. This beer should be ready to enjoy four weeks after brew day.","Extract Version
Replace malts with 5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Dissolve extract completely in warm reverse osmosis water and proceed with the boil."

Recipe by Bjørne Røthe, adapted by Stan Hieronymus and the editors of Zymurgy
Bjørne’s original recipe was for 120 liters (31.7 US gal.), which is a full US barrel and a bit more than most North American homebrewers can comfortably produce. We have scaled Bjørne’s recipe down to a more manageable volume and estimated the vital stats.","Ingredients:
MALTS
11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) pale malt
11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) Pilsner malt
HOPS
3 oz. (85 g) East Kent Golding or Northern Brewer at start of boil
YEAST
Kveik #2 Rivenes preferred but not commonly available. A good substitute is Kveik #1 Sigmund’s Voss, available as Omega Yeast Labs OYL-061 Voss Kveik, The Yeast Bay Sigmund’s Voss Kveik, East Coast Yeast ECY43 Nordic Farmhouse, and Inland Island Yeast INIS-441 Norwegian Farmhouse
ADDITIONAL ITEMS
Juniper branches (try to find Juniperus communis)
Specifications:
Yield: 6.6 US gallons (25 L)
Original Gravity: 1.097 (23.1°P), estimated
Final Gravity: 1.020 (5.1°P), estimated
ABV: 10.4% by volume
SRM: 7","Directions:
Heat juniper infusion in the kettle. Pour it on the malts. Add new water to the kettle (leaving the same juniper there), then heat that. This is the sparge water. (When Bjørne runs off wort, he tops up with this thinner infusion.) The lauter filter is juniper branches. You want only the tips, no berries, for both the infusion and the sparge water. The mash liquor is 158°F (70°C) when Bjørne starts ladling it onto the mash, and 167°F (75°C) at the end, because the fire heats the infusion while he ladles it on. The temperature of the mash is not known. Mash one hour, then lauter very slowly, about half an hour for the 25-liter batch. Boil for 6 to 7 hours, until 6.6 gal. (25 L) remain. It’s not clear how much wort there is before the boil begins because it starts immediately when there is enough wort to cover the bottom. Add hops when boil begins. Cool wort to 99°F (37°C) and pitch kveik yeast. The fermenter is insulated so the beer will stay warm during fermentation. Ferment 3 days. Bjørne does not measure original or final gravity. Sigmund Gjernes uses about the same process, but less malt. Bjørne uses 420 g of malt per liter, while Sigmund uses 333 g. Sigmund’s beer is roughly 8.5%, so this beer is probably 10–11% ABV.","Extract Version
Use 9 lb. (4.08 kg) pale liquid malt extract and 9 lb. (4.08 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract in place of the malted grains. Dissolve extracts with hot juniper-infused water to a volume of 6.6 gal. (25 L) and boil 15 minutes to sterilize. Cool and pitch as above."

Efficiency: 84%","Directions:
Mash 2 qt./lb. at 149°F (65°C) for 90 minutes. Add ULTRA-FERM at the start of mash. The low mash temperature, enzyme, and rice really help dry out the beer. Target 5.2 mash pH. Increase to 168°F (76°C) for mash out and sparge. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at 60 and 30 minutes. Chill to 50°F (10°C), oxygenate well, and pitch yeast starter. Ferment at 51°F (11°C) for 7–10 days. Let free rise to 62°F (17°C) for 5 days, then slowly cool to 32°F (0°C) over the next week. We are fanatical about limiting cold-side oxidation and use CO2-filled Mylar balloons to prevent airlock suck-back while chilling. (Thank you to Marshall at Brülosohphy for the balloon idea.) Closed-pressure transfer to CO2-purged kegs and force carbonate to 2.8 vol. (5.6 g/L) CO2. Lager for at least 3 weeks. Clean, sanitize, repeat. Cheers!","EXTRACT VERSION
Substitute 7.5 lb. (3.4 kg) extra-light dry malt extract for pale two-row malt. Substitute 2 lb. (907 g) rice extract syrup for flaked rice. Dissolve sugar and extracts completely in RO water, then top off to desired boil volume. Proceed as above. Color will be slightly darker than all-grain recipe (3 SRM)."

In the 1970s, Munich Breweries like Paulaner began to notice that paler versions of their Oktoberfestbier were selling better than the classic, full-bodied, copper-colored brew. So Paualaner initiated a return to the more Vienna-style Oktoberfest, which was lighter in body and color, in an an attempt to make it still taste great and yet be less filling.The result was festbier, which was adopted in 1990 os Oktoberfest’s official beer.
Festiber provides a wonderful opportunity to fine-tune the balance between malty flavor, clean lager character, crisp though not quite bitter noble hop accents, and drinkability.","Ingredients:

This recipe courtesy of Amahl Turczyn with updates from Cigar City brewmaster Wayne Wambles.
Cigar City brewmaster Wayne Wambles deemed this recipe “pretty close to classic Jai Alai circa 2009-2010.” He made a few suggestions to bring this recipe closer to the original, including the use of the Thames Valley ale yeast strain, Munich malt in the 6-10*L range, and an updated water profile that “pushes the sulfate up to 150 ppm and the chloride up to 125 ppm. This will jack up the calcium, but we find that quite a bit of it precipitates out.” Many thanks, Wayne!","Ingredients:

Recipe by Chuck Spypeck.
Some readers may recognize Chuck Skypeck as the technical brewing projects manager for the Brewers Association, the AHA’s parent organization. But once upon a time, Chuck served as co-owner and brewmaster at Boscos Restaurant & Brewing Co. in Memphis and Nashville, Tenn., and Little Rock, Ark.
According to Boscos’ website, it was “the first North American brewery regularly making a stone beer, the original being Rauchenfels in Neustadt, Germany. Boscos began brewing Famous Flaming Stone Beer in 1993.”
Of the hot-stone process, Chuck says, “The flavors created, while unique, are subtle. For this reason, all my steinbier formulas minimized extemporaneous and competing flavors. What really worked well was somewhat of a helles recipe.”
Chuck adds, “This formula produced a very drinkable beer that carried the unique caramel flavor created by the stones. It was our number-one-selling beer in all our pubs. We typically sold about 7 barrels a week, week in and week out, all year round.”","Ingredients:

Here's what recipe creator Kurt Elia has to say on Trappist Tripel:
A unique aspect of this recipe is the small yeast starter I add to the bottling bucket. When I have brewed high-alcohol beers in the past, bottle conditioning has been slow. Sometimes it never reached the desired level of carbonation. Tripels are supposed to be nicely effervescent, so I didn’t want to take any chances. This method worked well, and I will make this a regular part of my process for big, bottle-conditioned beers in the future.","Ingredients:

Conduct a single infusion mash for 75 minutes at 149°F (65°C), adjusting strike water with gypsum and lactic acid to achieve a mash pH of 5.4. (I used 1 tsp. gypsum and 3 mL 88% lactic acid solution to achieve this, but your mileage may vary!) Fly sparge with 170°F (76.7°C) water to collect 7.3 gal. (27.6 L) wort. Add white sugar to hot wort, stirring well to avoid scorching, and then boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and Whirlfloc as indicated, to yield 5.75 gal. (21.8 L) wort. Rack to fermenter, chill to 62°F (16.7°C), oxygenate well, and pitch yeast slurry. (Be sure to reserve some yeast for bottling—see below.) Allow the temperature to rise slowly to 70°F (21.1°C) as fermentation progresses over the course of the next 4 to 5 days. If desired, add 10 drops of Fermcap S once the kräusen forms. When fermentation has slowed (about 6 to 7 days into fermentation), allow the temperature to rise to 72°F (22.2°C) and hold it there for another week prior to bottling. Midway through this week, add a solution of Polyclar mixed with 350 mL boiled water, stirring gently to avoid too much oxygenation. The day before bottling, make a mini yeast starter using 1.4 oz. (40 g) dry malt extract in 500 mL water. Do not add hop pellets or Fermcap to the starter, as it will go directly into the bottles. After boiling for 30 minutes, chill the starter to 62°F (16.7°C) and add 10 to 15 mL of thick yeast slurry. Allow starter to grow on a stir plate at room temperature for about 18 hours or until it has reached high kräusen. Rack beer into bottling bucket and measure volume of finished beer. The goal is to add enough priming sugar to provide 3.3 vol. (6.6 g/L) CO2. For 5 gal. of beer at 72°F (22.2°C), this would be about 6.7 oz. (190 g) of corn sugar, but I reduced this to 6 oz. (170 g) to account for unfermented extract in the actively fermenting mini-starter. An even 6 oz. (170 g) worked well for me. Bottle in heavy glass bottles that can handle the high carbonation of this beer, and allow bottles to condition at room temperature for 4 weeks.","Extract Version

In 1995, AHA founder Charlie Papazian penned a reflection of microbrewing history as it might have appeared in the 21st century. Charlie was looking forward to the new millennium, what it would bring for homebrewing and the beer industry, and how beer patrons would view the burgeoning new beer scene of the late 20th century.
With Charlie doing a bit of prediction for the remaining 5 years of the '90s, it seemed appropriate to develop a recipe that payed homage to a people who were also forward-thinking innovators: the Aztecs.

Charlie Papazian: “Why do I brew? The answer is simple—it is still fun for me. I love the routine of planning and preparing the ingredients the days before. Then there’s the anticipation of waking up in the morning and going out to my brew garage… I mash in, set the timer and have breakfast. I’m brewing, the aroma of malt and hops soon fills the air, and I simply love it.”

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 12 quarts (11.5 liters) of 140°F (60°C) water to crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold temperature 132°F (53°C) for 30 minutes. Add 6 quarts (6 liters) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add malt extract, agave extract syrup, and 60-minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and the Irish moss. When one minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (20 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C) and ferment for about 7 to 12 days, or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.  Best if aged for six months or more!",

The sulfate:chloride ratio does make a difference. You can turn this beer out perfectly in 10 days or less.

Single infusion mash option: Include the melanoidin malt and mash at 152°F (67°C) for 90 minutes followed by a 10-minute mash out at 168°F (76°C). Decoction option: Omit melanoidin malt. Mash in at 132°F (56°C) and hold for 10 minutes. Heat mash to 147°F (64°C), and then pull a decoction of 1/3 the total mash volume. Maintain the main mash for an hour at 147°F (64°C). Meanwhile, heat the decoction to 156–158°F (69–70°C), hold for 10 minutes, and then bring to a boil. Boil decoction for 10 minutes and then raise the temperature of the main mash to 156–158°F (69–70°C). Return the decoction to the main mash to achieve a mash-out temperature of 168°F (76°C). Both versions: Add first wort hops to kettle, and then lauter, sparge, and collect enough wort to yield 5 gal. (18.9 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding remaining hops as indicated. Ferment at 49°F (9°C) for 8 days and then warm to 52°F (11°C) for 4 more days before cooling by 2°F (1.1°C) per day to 34°F (1°C) for lagering.

This partial-mash brut IPA by Chris Colby is bursting with tropical fruit notes from New Zealand hop varieties. Any brewer who has made beers using the “extract plus grains” method will have no problem making this beer. The only thing you need beyond the typical extract brewing setup is a 2- or 3-gallon (7.5 to 11.4 liter) beverage cooler and a large nylon sack to hold the grains. For best results, use the freshest malt extract possible and make the 2 qt. (roughly 2 L) yeast starter. If you help the yeast out, it will make a great beer for you.","Ingredients:

Place the crushed malts and flaked maize in a large steeping bag. Heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) of water to 164°F (73.3°C) and pour it into the cooler. Lower the grain bag into the hot water and use a large spoon to stir the mixture. The temperature should settle at around 152°F (66.7°C). Cover and rest the mash for 45 minutes. Stick as closely as possible to the specified volume and temperatures to get the most out of this small mash. In the last 15 minutes, add 3 qt. (2.8 L) of water to your brew kettle and heat it to around 170°F (76.7°C). In addition, before the partial mash finishes, heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) of water to 170°F (76.7°C). Collect the wort from the partial mash by drawing off roughly 2 cups (473 mL) of wort from the spigot. Pour the wort into your brew kettle. Then, add roughly two cups (473 mL) of hot water to the top of the grain bed in the cooler. Repeat until the sparge water is depleted. Then, run off the remaining wort and pour it in your brew kettle. Once the entire wort is collected, stir in half the malt extract and heat the wort to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the bittering hops at the beginning of the boil. Add the Irish moss, yeast nutrients, and the remaining malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Add the whirlpool hops after knockout and let them steep for roughly 10 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill the wort, allowing hops and trub to settle, with the lid on your brew pot, for at least 30 minutes. Rack the wort to a fermenter and add cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. Leave as much trub and hop debris behind in the kettle as is reasonably possible. Aerate the wort well and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). When fermentation has peaked and then slowed down for a few days, add the enzyme. Let the fermentation go to completion, and then add your dry hops to a secondary fermenter and rack the beer onto them. Dry hop for 7–10 days and then bottle or keg.",

The Camp Fire--the most devastating wildfire in California's history--has hit close to home for Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. While the Chico brewery was spared, many of Sierra Nevada's employees, patrons and neighbors lost everything as the Camp Fire ravaged northern Californian.
To help raise much needed support for the recovery efforts, Sierra Nevada has created a beer called Resilience IPA. Sierra Nevada, along with many of its professional brewing peers, will be brewing and selling Resilience IPA with all proceeds donated to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund through Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation.
It is our hope that homebrewers will make a batch of Resilience IPA in solidarity with Sierra Nevada and pro breweries across the country. While we can't sell our creations and donate the proceeds, please consider donating to the Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation if you are able.

Charlie Papazian presents Puna Coast Black Lager, named after the black coast of Hawaii, in the article ""Drinkably Dark: Exploring Black Lager"" featured on page 51 of the Janurary/February 2002 edition of Zymurgy magazine.
The concept of this recipe, and Charlie's article as a whole, is that all dark beers cannot be simplified as heavy and strong. This German-style schwarzbier is an example of a dark beer that is very similar to its sessionable, lighter-colored cousins. In fact, if blindfolded, the color of many well crafted schwarzbiers is often a surprise based on the preconceived notions of what a dark ale ""should taste and smell like."" Just like it is taught on the first day of kindergarten, you can't always judge a book by its cover.","Ingredients:

The beer styles that we are familiar with in modern day have, of course, evolved for many years. A few years ago, Alastair Kocho-Williams wrote a piece in Zymurgy magazine about how Soviet beer styles evolved from four standardized Soviet beer groups in 1927 to many styles encompassing dark ales, dark lagers, ""black"" beers, ""caramel"" beers, and much more. This beer was taken from the Soviet-style karamelnoe (""caramel,"" which would be renamed later as barkhatnoe, meaning ""velvet""), which was a low-alcohol beer that was was brewed quickly, sometimes with Lactobacillus as well as yeast, and pasteurized so that it finished with a sweet flavor, syrupy aftertaste, and malty aroma. This style survived the Great Patriotic War of 1941–45, and some still survive to this day.

From AHA founder and recipe creator Charlie Papazian:
""I recently formulated a new beer called Visionary Mild. Its a mild light brown ale brewed with a relatively new type of crystal malt made by Simpsons called Double Roasted Crystal (DRC) malt, 120°L. It's a crystalized caramel malt of a similar genre as Belgian maltster Castle Malting's Special B and U.S. maltster Briess's Roasted Caramel Malts. All of them add a degree of mildly sweet, dark caramel along with raisin, prune, and dried fruit-like complexity to beer.
""Also significant in the recipe is the traditional English brown malt, which lends an unusual toasted, but not sweet, dryness to beers. If you are formulating beers that tend to head in the direction of sweet and fruity, a bit of brown malt has a good counter-balancing effect on the overall impression of drinkability.
""Traditional English hops are used in order to not overshadow the malt character; in other words, I'm not trying to overpower this beer with American citrus and fruity hop character. I personally have access to home cultivated transplanted wild hops, which with late hopping lend a mild protein-like deliciousness to beer (umami). American Crystal hops or UK East Kent Goldings are also good options for dry hopping. Avoid some of the traditional English ale yeast strains that tend to create diacetyl; it will collide with the malt complexity in this beer. American Ale yeast is a cleaner and better option.""","Ingredients:
6.5 lb. (3 kg) Maris Otter English 2-row malt
12 oz. (340 g) Simpson's Double Roasted Crystal 120°L

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 8 quarts (7.6 L) of 140° F (60° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize, and hold the temperature at 132° F (56° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water, add heat to bring temperature up to 155° F (68° C), and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter, and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60-minutes hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remain, add the 5-minute hops. After the boil is finished, add the whirlpool hops and allow to steep. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5 gallons (19 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21°C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.","Extract Option
Substitute the Maris Otter malt with 5 lb. (2.3 kg) of light malt extract syrup or 4.3 lb. (1.95 kg) dry light malt extract. Also consider reducing the whirlpool hop addition to from 1.25 oz. to 1 oz. (28 g). Place crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 155° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain out, rinse with 3 quarts (3 L) of hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add malt extract and 60 minute hops. Bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remain, add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add the steep-after-boiling hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add cold water to achieve a 5.5 gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21°C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping.

Brewers Notes
""There are two keys to brewing this beer. The first is the malt bill. It's fairly complex, and for that reason some patience is required. In my experience, the more complex the grain bill, the more conditioning the beer needs for the flavors to meld. I also recommend sourcing the debittered dark malts to keep the roastiness restrained. The other key is fermentation. The strain of yeast is largely unimportant and can be either lager or ale as long as esters are restrained. I used an ale yeast that ferments cleanly at lower temperatures just because it was available. The recipe is also fairly dry for the style, which is a personal preference, so just look for yeast that ferments cleanly, attenuates well, and can handle the higher ABV.""","Ingredients:

At flameout, wait until wort cools to 180° F (82° C) to avoid volatizing hop oils. Set timer for 40 minutes and add first hop stand addition. After 10 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, add the second and third hop stand additions. After the total hop stand of 40 minutes, chill wort to 67° F (19° C), decant starter, pitch yeast, and aerate. Over the course of the two-week fermentation, ramp the temperature up to 73° F (23° C) to ensure full attenuation. On approximately day five of fermentation, when attenuation has reached about 80 percent, add the first dry hop addition. (Optionally, you could add a can of thawed pineapple or grapefruit juice concentrate at this point.) Five days later, remove the first dry hop addition, add the second addition, and dry hop for five more days. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2 (or add 3.75 oz./106 g corn sugar if bottling) and drink fresh. Prost!","Extract Version

Heat 2 qt. (2 L) water to 172° F (78° C) and then add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155° F (68° C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew. After 45 minutes, add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167° F (75° C). Then pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170° F (77° C) water. Discard the grains. Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gal. (9.5 L). Add dextrose/corn sugar, malt extract, and 60-minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minutes remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add the 0-minute hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold-water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5 gal. (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (13° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the hop powder for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks.

Cider generally doesn't contain much in the way of yeast nutrients, so most hard cider recipes call for an addition. However, malted barley wort does contain yeast nutrients, and low-gravity wort ""tailings"" collected after you've finished sparging a high-gravity all-grain beer are easy to com by—just sparge a bit longer once your beer volume has been reached. The extra low-gravity wort provides excellent yeast nutrient for cider fermentation and lends a pleasing body, flavor, and complexity.","Ingredients:
4 gal. (15.1 L) 1.050 gravity apple juice
1 gal. (3.8 L) malted barley wort (preferably 1.040–1.050 gravity)
sweetener (optional, see directions)
2 tsp. (10 mL) cream of tartar
2 12-ounce (355 mL) cans frozen apple (or other fruit) juice concentrate to back-sweeten.
English ale yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5.25 gallons (20 L)
Original Gravity: 1.050 (12° P)
Final Gravity: 1.004–1.006 (1–1.5° P) before backsweetening
ABV: about 6%","Directions:
Boil 1 gallon (3.79 L) wort tailings (see intro for explanation) for at least 15 minutes. If wort is less than 1.050 OG, collect a greater volume and boil until target gravity is reached (or add unhopped malt extract or other sweeteners. Just don’t add hops!). Pour apple juice into a sanitized 6.5-gallon (24.6 L) fermenter, splashing to aerate. Rack wort onto juice, make sure temperature equalizes at about 68° F (20° C), and pitch yeast. Ferment out completely, and then wait until yeast begins to fall out and the cider starts to clarify. Rack off lees into a sanitized keg, backsweeten to taste, force carbonate to desired CO2 level, and chill to serving temperatures of no higher than 40° F (4° C). Note: the final volume at kegging is 5 gallons (18.9 L). It is not recommended to bottle this recipe if doing the backsweetening process. Cream of Tartar For added balance, a modest addition of acidity really helps bring a nice zip to cider made from table apples rather than true cider apples. Most table varieties have high sugar content and only a bit of acidity, with almost no astringency. Fortunately, adding acidity is as easy as blending in one or two teaspoons of cream of tartar, a common baking ingredient. It’s tartaric acid, made from purified grape skin residues, and thus has an astringent character as well. I usually go with two teaspoons (10 mL) boiled in about 1 fluid oz. (30 mL) of water in the microwave to sanitize, and then dissolved into the cider before backsweetening. Backsweetening & Other Sweeteners Personally, I like to maximize the apple component of cider. Apple juice concentrate is my favorite way to backsweeten. Yes, it is highly fermentable, so the fermented, blended cider must be refrigerated, preferably after kegging and force carbonation, but the extra apple flavor and aroma is very appealing if you get the balance right. For a 5-gallon (18.9 L) volume at a finishing gravity of 1.004 to 1.006 (1 to 1.5° P), I blend in just enough frozen apple juice concentrate to bring the gravity up about one point Plato to 1.012 (2.5° P) and then taste. This ends up being about two 12-ounce (355 mL) cans of concentrate, but I always have extra on hand. Remember if you choose to carbonate your cider, that will affect the perception of dryness too. Learn more about backsweetening cider.      ","Extract Option
Dissolve 1.4 lb. (625 g) unhopped extra-pale malt extract syrup or 1.15 lb. (522 g) extra-light dry malt extract and other sweeteners (if desired) into one gallon (3.8 L) of water. Boil 15 minutes to sanitize. Pour apple juice into sanitized, 6.5-gallon (24.6 L) fermenter, splashing to aerate. Rack wort onto juice, make sure temperature equalizes at about 68° F (20° C) and pitch yeast. Ferment out completely, and then wait until yeast begins to fall out and the cider starts to clarify. Rack off lees into a sanitized keg, back-sweeten to taste, force carbonate to desired CO2 level, and chill to serving temperatures of no higher than 40° F (4° C)."

Few beers can be called ""meaty"" in both the figurative and literal senses of the word. Expedition Stout, from Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, Mich., is one. Based on the strong, well hopped ales that England once shipped to the czar's court, Expedition Stout measures between 10 and 11 percent ABV. You don't seek out a beer like this just for the buzz, that's for sure. Expedition Stout goes well with a wide variety of foods, from roasts and steaks to rich chocolate desserts.
This clone recipe was originally featured in the November/December 2002 issue of Zymurgy magazine.","Ingredients:
12.5 lb. (5.67 kg) two-row malt
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) black malt
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) roasted barley
0.5 lb. (227 g) chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (227 g) flaked barley
4 oz. (113 g) Caramunich malt
4 lb. (1.8 kg) amber malt extract
3 lb. (1.36 kg) dark malt extract
4 oz. (113 g) Centennial hops (45 min.)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Centennial hops (30 min.)
0.25. oz (7 g) Centennial hops (flameout)
0.25 oz. (7 g) calcium chloride
Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (19 L)
Original Gravity: 1.110-1.115
Final Gravity: 1.028-1.032
ABV: 10.70%
SRM: 81
Boil Time: 90 minutes","Directions:
Mash rest at 150°F (66°C) for 20 minutes, collect wort slowly, and sparge at 170°F (77°C). Add malt extract to filled kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding 4 oz. (113 g) of hops at 45 minutes, 1.5 oz. (42 g) at 30 minutes, and 0.25. oz (7 g) at flameout. Pitch twice the usual amount of HEALTHY yeast cells, and aerate twice as much as normal. Pitch a new, healthy yeast culture to prime at bottling. Prime to reach about 2.3 volumes (4.6 g/L) of CO2. Age for as long as you can wait, ideally at least three to six months. Primary Fermentation: 7–10 days at 72°F (22°C) Secondary Fermentation: 2 days at 55°F (13°C), 7 days at 40°F (4°C) Notes:  The key to success is a healthy, vigorous yeast, asserts Alec Mull, who provided the recipe. “Otherwise, the beer will never go terminal, and the residual starch will make it cloyingly sweet.” For a 5-gallon batch of imperial stout in the 1.100 OG range, he recommends “pitching the slurry from at least a 1-liter starter, or brew another 5-gallon batch of normal-strength stout or ale and repitch the slurry from that.”","Substitutions:
Homebrewers may use up to 5 percent caramel malt in the mash, depending on how sweet they wish the beer to be. Any of the high-alpha acid Pacific Northwest hops may be used alone or in combination. The homebrewer may also substitute English hops for a ""more mellow, traditional imperial."""

From WeldWerks: “Our version of a New England-style IPA featuring a huge citrus and tropical fruit character from the Mosaic, Citra, and El Dorado hops, a softer, fluffier mouthfeel from the lower attenuation, and the characteristic New England hop haze.

SRM: 50","Directions:
Mash grains at 156° F (69° C) for 60 minutes. The high mash temperature, caramel malt sweetness, and heft will help balance the beer when you dry it out with the bourbon/oak addition later on. Sparge at 168° F (76° C). Chill wort to 65° F (18° C), ferment for 7 days, and then allow temperature to rise to 68° F (20° C) and ferment to completion. This typically takes 10–14 days.
While you are waiting, boil 0.5 oz. (14 g) of white, untoasted French oak chips, 0.5 oz. (14 g) medium toast chips, and 0.5 oz. (14 g) heavy char chips in 8 oz. (240 mL) of water for about 5 minutes. Drain off the water, and soak the wet chips in 8 oz. (240 mL) of cheap, rotgut plastic bottle whiskey or bourbon for 1 week. Drain, donate the booze to your nearest sink (or even better, use it in a pork shoulder marinade prior to smoking) and this time soak the chips in 750 mL good-quality bourbon (cask strength is better if you are willing to make the sacrifice) for 4­ to 7 days. You should get vanilla from the white chips, coconut from the medium chips, and dark chocolate notes from the heavy char. Begin tasting the bourbon after 3 days. After the boil in water and pre-soak in cheap booze to extract harshness, you should now get subtle, harmonious flavors and aromas from the chips.
You are looking for a good, sweet, vanilla, coconut, and chocolate character that complements both bourbon and stout. When these flavors are detectable, and work well with the bourbon, it’s time to blend the soaking liquid into your finished or nearly finished stout. Add to taste—you don’t have to use all the bourbon, and you don’t have to add the soaked chips either, unless you feel the beer needs more oak character. Less is definitely more here—it seems like a whole lot of booze and a pitiful amount of wood, but this ratio will allow you to pull subtle, sweet barrel nuances from the chips, rather than harsh, dry tannins, charred wood flavors and bitterness. The bourbon itself will provide much of the flavor, and will bump up the alcohol on your stout a bit too, leaving you with closer to 10­–11% ABV, which is right in line with Dragon’s Milk. It will also dry out your beer appreciably, which is a good thing, because we’ve intentionally made the beer thick and sweet by mashing high.
If you choose to add the chips along with the bourbon, it will be worth monitoring the beer every few days. Chips have a lot of surface area, and the oak can very quickly become overpowering. Rack the beer off the chips when you have noticeable vanilla notes, blanketing your secondary with CO2 to avoid oxygen pickup. After a month or two, your stout’s flavors will blend and mellow appreciably.","Partial-Mash Option
Reduce pale two-row to 22 oz. (623 g). Substitute 8 lb. (4.08 kg) pale malt extract for the remaining two-row malt and 2 lb. (0.9 kg) Munich malt extract for the Munich malt. Mash chocolate and crystal malts, black barley, and flaked barley along with 22 oz.

Place crushed crystal malt in 2 gal. (7.6 L) of 155° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Then strain, rinse with 3 qt. (2.8 L) hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add the malt extract and 60-minute hops. Bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and Irish moss. When boiling is finished, add the “end-of-boil” hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 15 to 30 minutes, or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (20.8 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Ferment at about 70° F (21° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the first charge of dry hops. If you have the capability, “cellar” the beer at about 55° F (13° C) for about two weeks. Add the second charge of dry hops one week before bottling.
Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

American cream ale with jalapeño chiles. Courtesy of Paul Holder and the Bay Area Society of Homebrewers.
Paul Holder, a founding member of the Bay Area Society of Homebrewers (BASH), has long enjoyed a blonde ale recipe originally plucked from the pages of Zymurgy six or seven years ago. BASH added a Tex-Mex twist by adding jalapeños to the mix. With the chiles and maize, this liquid bread is more like liquid jalapeño cornbread.

Determined to find a drinkable, flavorful beer for warmer days, but also wanting to remain coherent and fresh for evening activities, AHA Founder Charlie Papazian created “Embracing Sunset Lager,” a wonderfully balanced and relatively low alcohol lager that combines lightly toasted malt flavors with subtle hop character. This recipe was originally featured in 2002 March/April Zymurgy.
If you want to experiment with hops, choose low alpha acid ratings. High alpha acid hops will overpower the malt character and defeat the purpose of this beer - to enjoy on a summer sunset! Charlie believes this beer is a warm weather standard that should be brewed many times as supplies run out. Only one way to find out, though...","Ingredients:
7.0 lb (3.0 kg) Munich malt (7° L)
8 oz (225 g) Belgain aromatic malt
1.25 oz (35 g) Santiam, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood pellet hops (60 min)
0.6 oz (16 g) Crystal, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood whole hops or pellets (5 min)

A step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 7.5 quarts (7.1 L) of 145° F (63° C) water to the crushed grain, stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132° F (53° C) for 30 minutes. Add 4 quarts (3.8 L) of boiling water and add heat to bring temperature up to 157° F (69.5° C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Then raise temperature to 167° F (75° C), lauter and sparge with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 170° F (77° C) water. Collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of runoff and add 60 minute hops and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes or long enough to end up with 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. When 10 minutes remain add 0.6 ounces of hops. After a total wort boil of at least 60 minutes (5.5 gallons should remain) turn off the heat and cool all the wort. Use an immersion cold water bath or heat exchanging coils. Then strain and sparge into a sanitized fermenter. Pitch a good dose of healthy active lager yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C) , then primary ferment at temperatures at about 55° F (12.5° C); make sure that nearly all of the fermentation is completely before lagering. Rack from the primary to the secondary. Your net yield will be five gallons (19 L) to the secondary. Lager between 35-40° F (2-4.5° C) for four to six weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when lagering is complete.","Extract Option
Ingredients for 5 gal (19 L):
(2) 3.3 lb cans (6.6 lb or 3 kg) pale/amber malt extract syrup
1.6 oz (45 g) Santiam, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood pellet hops (60 min)
0.6 oz (16 g) Crystal, Tettnanger or Mt. Hood whole hops or pellets (5 min)
0.25 tsp (1.25 ml) powdered Irish moss
0.75 cup (180 ml) corn sugar for priming bottles or 0.33 cup (80 ml) corn sugar for kegging
Oktoberfest style lager yeast or other Munich/Bavarian style lager yeast
Directions:
Add malt extract to 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) hot water.
Bring to a boil and add 60 minute hops. Boil for 50 minutes. Then add remaining Irish moss. When five minutes remain add the 5 minute hops.
After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which two gallons (7.5 L) of cold water have been added. If necessary add additional cold water to achieve a 5.8 gallon (22 L) batch size. Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F ( 21° C).
When evidence of fermentation is seen ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) range for about seven days or until fermentation is complete and appears to clear and darken. At this point rack (transfer) the beer into a secondary fermenter and lager between 35-40° F (2-4.5° C) for four to six weeks.

Substitute the pale malt for 6.6 lb (3 kg) pale/light liquid malt extract.
Add the crush roasted barley, black malt, and crystal malt to one gallon (3.8 L) of 160° F (71° C) water. Let steep for 30 minutes. Afterward, strain out the spent grains, sparge with hot water, and collect the liquid extract. Add 1 gallon (4 L) additional water, the malt extract syrup, and all of the hops. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for one hour. When 10 minutes remain add Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (7.5 L) of cold water have been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 6-gallon (23 L) batch size. Add a starter culture of yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Preferably ferment at 65–72° F (18–22° C) for about 7–12 days or until fermentation is complete and the beer appears to clear and darken.

Fermentation: If using a pure-culture, follow the guidelines for ordinary grisette and allow an extra day or two at warm temperatures if needed. The beer can be packaged at approximately 2 weeks old and consumed fairly fresh. This allows for grisette to modernize as saison has, changing from an aged mixed-culture historic beer into a modern pure-culture beer that is consumed fresh.
If using a mixed culture, ferment with your chosen blend until primary fermentation is complete. At this point, age at cellar temperature for 2–5 months (or longer if the FG is not yet stable) before packaging.
Packaging: Bottle or keg at 9–10 days from the start of fermentation (or longer if needed for clarity and complete fermentation). A slight haze is OK and likely would be fitting for the beer. I shoot for around 2.8–3.1 volumes (5.6–6.2 g/L) of CO2, depending on when I am packaging and the yeast I am using.
Optional: Dry hop with ≤1 g/L (≤0.13 oz./gal.) Styrian Goldings for approximately 4–5 days, starting at the end of fermentation when the beer would be cooled down.","EXTRACT VERSION

“Our passion is Pilsner-driven,” says Brian Peters. “Pilsner is simple and refreshing all the way through, with enough hops to make it interesting. All good Pilsner recipes start with German Pilsner malt—and only Pilsner malt—to be authentic. I wouldn’t mess with anything else besides maybe a little bit of acid malt,” he advises homebrewers. “Water is critical, as Pilsner was not a style originally brewed in places with hard water. It’s too hard to get the hops and malt flavor right when you have that alkalinity, so we lower ours a bit. We have a pH of 6 when we mash in and when we sparge. Anything over 7, I can’t recommend.”","Ingredients:

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/johns-world-famous-dark-lager/,Not Found,"Dark American lager can be deceiving style to the eye. Ranging up to the mid-20 SRM, these beers may look as if they should be exploding with roast and coffee notes akin to stouts and porters, but can taste and smell more like a lighter-colored American lager.
Using de-husked dark specialty malts, like Carafa Special II, allows for a darker color without instilling the bitter and acrid notes typical of in-husk dark roasted barleys. This clean style should have very little malt in the aroma, a mild sweetness in the taste and subdued hoppiness in the flavor and nose.

Heat 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) water to 172° F (77.5° C) and then add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155° F (68° C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew. After 45 minutes, add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167° F (75° C). Then, pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170° F (77° C) water. Discard the grains. Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produced, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract and 60-minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn, off the heat and add the 0-minute hops. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2 gallons (8 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.5-gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at temperatures of about 55° F (13° C) for one to two weeks, or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the first dry hop addition. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures of 35–45° F (1–7° C) for 3–6 weeks. Seven to ten days before bottling or kegging, add the second dry hop addition. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.",

It's about that time when we start preparing for St. Patrick's Day, so a dry stout is in order. Brewing dry stout is easy when you have the right water. Low-alkalinity water, such as distilled or reverse osmosis water, is well-suited for brewing a dry stout. Low alkalinity allows wort pH to fall into a desirable range and creates the tart, acidic flavor that is a signature of its style. This recipe is the perfect place to start with dry stout, whether you're more excited about St. Paddy's Day or just playing with your brewing water pH.

Mash pale malt and flaked barley in low-alkalinity water (acidify as necessary to produce a mash pH of 5.3–5.5) at a temperature of 146–150° F (63–65° C) for 60 minutes. Add roast barley to mash at the end of mashing period. A mash out step to 168° F (76° C) is helpful, but optional. Sparge the mash with low-alkalinity water that is acidified to a pH between 5.2 and 5.7. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Minimal brewing salts are desirable in the water. As a starting point, when using reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water, add a half-teaspoon of both gypsum and calcium chloride per 8 gallons (30 L) of water, or use a program such as Bru’n Water to guide the mineral and acid additions.","Extract Version:
A partial mash is recommended to help break down the flaked barley. Mash 2 lb. (0.9 kg) of pale malt with flaked barley in low-alkalinity water at 120–150°F (49–65°C) (lower temperature is better) for 60 minutes. Add roast barley at the end of the mash. Sparge mash with low-alkalinity water (acidified as above). Substitute 3.5 lb. (1.59 kg) of liquid pale malt in the recipe. Use low-alkalinity water to dilute extract. Boil as indicated above.
Variations:
Many English hop varieties can be substituted in this beer. Irish ale yeast is preferred for its ester profile; however, a clean U.S. ale yeast may be substituted. For broadened flavor, an ounce or so of the roast barley may be substituted with black, coffee, or chocolate malt. If preferred, a separate liquor made from steeping the roast malt in low-alkalinity water can be created and added to the finished wort."

Boil Time: 75 minutes","Directions:
[This recipe is featured in the January/February 2018 issue of Zymurgy magazine.] Make your yeast starter 2–3 days ahead of time. In a large kitchen pot (not your brew pot), heat 2 gallons (8 L) of water to 159° F (71° C). Place crushed malts in a nylon steeping bag and steep them in this water for 60 minutes. Hold temperature as close to 148° F (65° C) as you can reasonably manage over this period. (This is a small mash.) Stir occasionally. Additionally, heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to 170° F (77° C) in a small pot. And finally, heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to a boil in your brew pot. When the mash is over, transfer the grain bag to a 3-gallon (11-L) beverage cooler. (The kind with a spigot for dispensing beverages.) Pour the wort from the small mash gently into the cooler. Recirculate the wort by drawing off one or two cups into a measuring cup (or similar) and returning this wort to the top of the cooler. Repeat until at least 8 cups have been recirculated. Begin running off wort by collecting 1–2 cups of wort from cooler and transferring it to the brew pot. After each transfer, add an equal volume of water to the cooler from the pot of 170° F (77° C) water. Once this water (the sparge water) runs out, simply empty the cooler by continually drawing off 1 to 2 cups and moving it to the brew pot. When you are finished collecting wort from the cooler, dissolve roughly half of the malt extract in the brew pot and resume boiling. Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding hops with 60 minutes the boil. Do not let volume dip below 3 gallons (11 L) during boil. Top up with boiling water, if needed, to avoid this. Stir in the remaining malt extract during the final 10 minutes of the boil. When the boil is finished, cool the wort to 54° F (12° C), or as cool as you can get it with a reasonable effort. Transfer to a sanitized bucket fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch the sediment from the yeast starter. Ferment, allowing the temperature to rise to 64° F (18° C). Take the lid off the bucket for the 1 to 2 days when the fermentation is at it’s most vigorous. Reseal the bucket and affix the airlock, as you normally would, after this period. When fermentation is over, prime beer with corn sugar in bottling bucket. If using standard beer bottles, prime for 3 volumes (6 g/L) of CO2 using 6.5 oz. (180 g) of corn sugar. If you are using heavy wheat beer bottles, prime for 4 volumes (8 g/L) of CO2 using 9.5 oz. (270 g) of corn sugar. Store bottles somewhere warm for two weeks. Check for carbonation, then move beer to cold storage.",

Place crushed grains in 2 gal. (7.6 L) of 150° F (68° C) water and let steep for 30 minutes. Then strain, rinse with 3 qt. (3 L) hot water, and discard the crushed grains, reserving the approximately 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of liquid to which you will now add malt extract and 75-minute hops. Bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 75 minutes. When 15 minutes, remain add the 15-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the Irish moss and zinc fortified yeast. When 1 minute remains, add the 1-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 75 minutes, turn off the heat.
Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Then strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5 gal. (19 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of the wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at a temperature of about 55° F (13° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from primary to a secondary and add the dry hops. Lager the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (2–7°C) for 4 to 8 weeks.

The beer styles that we are familiar with today have, of course, evolved for many years. A few years ago, Alastair Kocho-Williams wrote a piece in Zymurgy magazine about how Soviet beer styles evolved from four standardized Soviet beer groups in 1927 to many styles encompassing dark ales, dark lagers, “black” beers, “caramel” beers, and much more. We imagine that the Baltic porter would have fit into the black category, which requires that the beers have a minimum original gravity of 1.052 and a minimum ABV of 1.2%. This brew certainly fits into that category ending in a whopping 10.2% - the rye malt adds a nice spice to complement the traditional flavor profile of a Baltic porter.

A well-made Belgian-style beer does not have a solventy, hot alcohol flavor, which is why fermentation temperature of this classic style is key to ensuring your dubbel doesn’t end up with a harsh alcohol taste. This recipe has a complex, malty, rich aroma topped off with mild tartness from the cherry concentrate. If you can afford the Belgian candi syrup and it’s available to you, it’s definitely worth adding to your ingredient list, as it adds a more intense flavor and aroma than Belgian rock candi sugar. If you can’t find Belgian candi syrup, a great alternative is molasses.

Conduct a mini-mash in a 3-gallon (11.4 L) stock pot using a 5-gallon (18.9 L) nylon mesh paint strainer bag from the hardware/paint store. Crush the grain and put it in the mesh bag. Heat 6 qt. (5.7 L) water to 165°F (74°C) (a ratio of 2 qt./lb. or 4.2 L/kg), and immerse the grain bag. Make sure all the grain is thoroughly wetted quickly and check the temperature. The mash temperature of the grain and water should now be about 150–155°F (66–68°C). Let mash sit for a half hour. Add heat while stirring to raise the temperature to 155°F (68°C) and let mash sit for another half hour. Place 2 gallons (7.6 L) water in a 5-gallon (18.9 L) boiling pot and heat to 165°F (74°C). Lift bag out of the first pot and let it drain for a minute before transferring to another pot. Swirl the bag in the pot to re-wet the grain and let it sit for 5 minutes. Lift the grain bag, drain, and discard the spent grain. Add the wort from the first pot and the 3.3 lb. (1.49 kg) of liquid light malt extract to the second pot, and begin your boil. Wait for the hot break to occur, and then add the hops. Boil for 60 minutes. Add the remaining 3.3. lb.

Note: You’ll need a 6-gallon (22.7-liter) or larger fermenter for this brew! Core apples by removing centers. A grill designed for smoking food is self-explanatory. If you use a charcoal grill, use enough charcoal to provide a low and even heat. Add pieces of fruitwood, maple, oak, hickory, mesquite, or your wood of choice atop the charcoal. Place apples on grill and cover with lid to enable wood to smolder. Leave vents open to keep the charcoal lit and alive. Don’t char the apples, but rather slow cook and smoke them. Remove when soft and lightly browned, yet firm enough to remove from grill. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate for later use, or add to the wort as instructed later in this recipe. Add malt extract and 60-minute hops to 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water. Bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 20 minutes remain, add smoked apples and the 20-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add Irish moss. After total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15–30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews. Strain out and sparge apples and hops, and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary, add additional cold water to achieve a 5.25 gal. (19 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well. Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70° F (21° C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident, ferment at about 55° F (12.5° C) for about one week or until fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. If you have the capability, “lager” the beer at temperatures between 35 and 45° F (1.5–7° C) for 3 to 6 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete. Let condition at room temperature for about a week before storing at colder temperatures.",

If you are conducting a cereal mash, begin that first. Add the rice and 1 lb. (454 g) milled Pilsner malt to a heavy-bottomed stockpot on the stove. Slowly raise the cereal mash temperature to at least 154–155° F (68° C). After a 15-minute rest at this temperature, add heat to slowly ramp up to a boil, and continue boiling for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, mash in with the remaining 9 lb. (4.08 kg) of Pilsner malt, starting with a protein rest at 122° F (50° C), monitoring pH if necessary. After 20 minutes, add the hot cereal mash to the main mash and blend well to stabilize at 149° F (65° C), then hold for 50 minutes. (If you are using flaked rice, skip the cereal mash directions and simply mash everything together, beginning with the protein rest, then raising the temperature to 149° F for the main rest.) Mash out at 168° F (76° C) and hold 10 minutes, then commence sparge. Run off and add first wort hops. Boil and add Whirlfloc and hops at stated intervals. Chill wort to 48° F (9° C) as quickly as possible, run off into fermenter, oxygenate, and cold-pitch yeast slurry from your previous Pilsner batch. Fermentation should be allowed to free-rise from 65° F to 68° F (18–20° C) during the first 2–4 days. Ferment at 48° F (9° C) until signs of fermentation are evident (usually within 36 hours). Ferment at 50° F (10° C) for the next two weeks, allow temperature to free-rise to 55° F (13° F), and ferment until activity slows.

Recipe courtesy Zymurgy editor-in-chief Dave Carpenter
As I worked my way through Kent Schultz’s vivid narrative of a September spent in the Hallertau, I was transported to the cozy biergartens and hop fields of southern Germany. I imagined the sun dropping a little lower into the sky every day as the heat of summer gave way to autumnal crispness. And when I learned that Georg conducted safety inspections at the G. Schneider & Sohn brewery in Kelheim, I found myself longing for a tall, vase-shaped glass of the Original.
This recipe is inspired by Schneider Weisse Tap 7 “Mein Original.” I would never presume to call this a clone, but it is a tribute to one of my favorite examples of one of my favorite beer styles. The technical details here are largely based on Stan Hieronymus’s interviews with brewmaster Hans-Peter Drexler in Brewing with Wheat, with a few adjustments here and there. I hope you like it.
I think the key to this beer is open fermentation. Yeasts, like humans, behave differently under pressure. An open fermenter lets the beer breathe and reduces carbon dioxide concentrations in the fermenting wort. It makes a difference in the flavor. If you maintain rigid sanitation throughout the process, an open fermenter needn’t worry you. I ferment in plastic buckets, so I loosely place the sanitized lid on top to keep airborne cat hair from falling in. When the beer hits final gravity, I close and seal the lid, add an airlock, and let it sit until I have time to bottle. There’s no need to secondary this beer, and it’s best when it’s fresh.","Ingredients:
MALTS
6 lb. (2.72 kg) German Pilsner malt
3 lb. 11 oz. (1.67 kg) German pale wheat malt
2 oz. (57 g) German chocolate wheat malt
HOPS
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertauer Herkules, 14% a.a. @ 45 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertauer Tradition, 5% a.a. @ 15 min
YEAST
Weihenstephan W68, available as Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan Weizen and White Labs WLP300 Hefeweizen Ale Yeast
Specifications:
Yield: 5 gallons (18.9 L)
Original Gravity: 1.052 (12.8° P)
Final Gravity: 1.011 (2.6° P)
ABV: 5.40%
IBU: 14
SRM: 9","Directions:
Mash in at 113° F (45° C) for a 10-minute ferulic acid rest. Using direct heat or a hot-water infusion, raise the mash temperature to 122° F (50° C) for a 10-minute protein rest, and then again to 147° F (64° C) to begin saccharification. After 5 to 10 minutes, pull a thick decoction of approximately 1/3 of the mash.
Keep the main mash at 147° F (64° C) while you separately step the decoction through rests of 152° F (67° C) for 10 minutes, 158° F (70° C) for 20 minutes, and finally to boiling. Boil the decoction for a few minutes—longer for more color development, shorter for less. Finally, return the decoction to the main mash and, if necessary, apply direct heat to hit mash-out at 168° F (76° C).
Collect enough wort to yield 5 gallons (18.9 L) after a 90-minute boil, and boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Pitch yeast at 62° F (17° C) and allow to free-rise to 72° F (22° C) over the course of 5 days. Leave the fermenter open until a gravity reading indicates that fermentation is at or very near completion, then seal with an airlock.
Bottle condition or force carbonate to 3.5 volumes (7 g/L) of CO2. This is at or above the limit of what many standard single-use beer bottles can handle, so if bottle conditioning, be sure to use sturdy glass.","EXTRACT OPTION
Replace the Pilsner and wheat malts with 7 lb. (3.2 kg) wheat malt extract syrup. Steep the chocolate wheat malt in 155° F (68° C) water for about half an hour, then remove the grain, dissolve extract in the steeping liquid, top up to your boil volume with tap water or reverse osmosis water, and proceed with the boil. If you conduct a concentrated boil, increase the Herkules addition proportionally or add it earlier in the boil to compensate for decreased hop utilization in high-gravity wort."

For many of us, urban living is a way of life, but that shouldn’t stop us from homebrewing. Mary Izett felt the same way when she faced the challenge of making beer in her Brooklyn apartment. You, too, can get creative with your brewing so that space isn’t a limitation. In this 3-gallon (11.3-liter) batch, Izett uses the the brew-in-a-bag (BIAB) method to make an all-grain, all-rye malt recipe. With a much looser mash and no sparge, an all rye beer or a traditional Grätzer is a piece of cake. This beer produces a spicy warmth and a bready flavor that will go perfectly with your cozy urban apartment.

In the mid-1800s, Baltic porter as a style relieved a formative transformation: lager yeast. Cold shipping of the first strong porter exports had mellowed the English-brewed porters, but beers brewed in the Baltic countries needed yeast adapted to ferment cool, not just condition cold.
Lager yeast therefore became the Baltic brewery standard; ale yeasts were unsuitable, and strong porters lost much of their ale yeast-derived ester and phenols,, gaining signature lager smoothness.","Ingredients:

Bock (German for goat) is likely a descendant of some of the oldest German lagers in the world. It evolved in the Franconia region of Germany, just north of modern day Bavaria. Bock has one of the largest ranges of the German beers and can be light (like a helles bock or maibock) to very dark; it can also be moderate to very strong in alcohol. A traditional bock is generally not hoppy, but more malt forward and brewed to at least a starting gravity of 1.064. We sat down with Larry Leinhart, owner and brewer at Prost Brewing Co. in Denver, Colorado to see how he brews his traditional bock. Prost Brewing Co. is  a brewery that has made a name for itself as a lager brewery. Their brewhouse is a classic copper German two-vessel system built in 1963. This recipe was originally featured in the November/December 2011 issue of Zymurgy. ","Ingredients:

Crush dark grains separately from pale malt (you will likely need to tighten the mill gap a bit for the smaller dark grains). In your brew pot, mash grains at 150° F (66° C) in 5.5 qt. (5.2 L) of brewing liquor for 45 minutes. Heat mash, stirring while you do, to 168° F (76° C). Scoop mash into a 3 gal. (11.4 L) beverage cooler, lined with a mesh steeping bag. Recirculate wort, then begin running off. Sparge with about 6 qt. (5.7 L) of 170° F (77° C) water until you yield 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) in your brew pot. Add water to achieve a pre-boil volume of 3.5 gal. (13.2 L). Boil wort hard for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Your post-boil volume should be slightly over 3 gal. (11.4 L) Keep a separate pot of water boiling in case you need to top up the wort during the boil. Stir in sugar and yeast nutrients for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and rack to fermenter. Aerate well, pitch yeast, and ferment at 70° F (21° C). Keg or bottle condition.

Heat 8.8 qt. (8.3 L) of brewing liquor to 163° F (73° C) and mash grains in your brew pot at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Stir the mash a couple times and heat briefly to maintain temperature. Heat mash, while stirring, to mash-out temperature of 168° F (76° C). Scoop mash into 3 gal. (11.4 L) beverage cooler lined with a mesh steeping bag. Recirculate wort until almost clear, then run off. Sparge steadily over 45 minutes to collect 3.5–3.8 gal. (13.2–14.4 L) of wort. You will need around 8 qt. (7.6 L) of sparge water, heated to 170 °F (77° C) for this. Bring wort to a boil. If hot break is not big and fluffy, add optional calcium chloride. Once the hot break forms, add bittering hops and vigorously boil wort for 60 minutes. Add remaining hops and Irish moss at times indicated to yield a post-boil volume around 3.25 gal. (12.3 L), topping up with boiling water if needed. Chill wort and rack to fermenter. Your yield should be about 3 gal. (11.4 L). Aerate wort thoroughly, pitch yeast, and ferment at 68° F (20° C). After fermentation stops, let beer settle for 2–3 days, then rack directly to keg or secondary fermenter. Carbonate to 2.6 volumes (5.2 g/L) of CO2.","Extract Version
Substitute 3.25 lb. (1.47 kg) pale malt extract syrup for pale malt. Mash remaining malts at 152° F (67° C) for 60 minutes. Drain, rinse grains with 170° F (77° C) reverse osmosis or distilled water. Dissolve extract completely in wort, then continue to sparge until desired boil volume is reached. Proceed as above."

SRM: 15","Directions:
Mash grains at 154° F (68° C) for one hour. Mash out at 168° F (76° C), and sparge at 170° F (77° C). Collect enough wort to account for evaporation from the long 120-minute boil. After an hour of boiling, add the 60-minute hops. At 15 minutes, add either 1 Whirlfloc tablet or 1 tsp. (5 g) of Irish moss. After the boil, stir wort vigorously to create a whirlpool and precipitate out the trub. Chill wort to 63° F (17° C) as quickly as possible, run off into a fermenter, pitch yeast, and oxygenate for 1 minute using pure oxygen. Fermentation should be allowed to free-rise to 67° F (19° C) during the first 4 days. It can then proceed at that temperature for another 10 days until terminal gravity is reached. Transfer to secondary (glass or stainless steel preferred), and cool to 36° F (2° C) and cold condition for 2–4 weeks. VARIATION While it is not traditional, some brewers choose to forgo the long boil and instead run the first 3–4 gallons (11–15 liters) of strong wort into the kettle, then stop runoff and boil that wort for 30 minutes. This creates caramel-like flavors and darkens the wort. Then the remainder of the wort can be run into the kettle and boiled another hour with the bittering hop charge.","Extract Version
Substitute pale malt with with 8.5 lb. (3.86 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Decrease roast barley to 4 oz. (113 g) and steep in 155° F (68° C) reverse osmosis (RO) water for 30 minutes. Remove grains. Dissolve extract and top up to desired boil volume with RO water. Add hops and boil 60 minutes. Proceed as above."

Alex Grote claimed bronze in the 2009 Great American Beer Festival® Pro-Am Competition for his Brighid’s Red ale, brewed by Doug Odell at Odell Brewing Co. in Fort Collins, Colo. Grote has been brewing since his college days and likes to blur the lines between styles, as is the case with his Irish Red ale. His inspiration for using rye in the recipe came from positive results from previous homebrew recipes–he liked the complexity it added to his beers.
Brighid’s Red won Best of Show at the 2009 Liquid Poetry Slam competition in Fort Collins. A representative from the Odell Brewing Co. helped judge at the Best of Show round, and the brewery recognized Grote’s beer as the one they wanted for Pro-Am, and the rest was history.
“Working with Doug Odell to brew this beer was an amazing experience,” said Grote. “It was particularly interesting to spend the day with Doug and talk about his beginnings and how he makes beer and to see the many similarities to homebrewing that still exist at the commercial level.” He found that many homebrew techniques like active mash temperature control and wort recirculation are used in the commercial brewery. And he was happy to see that the finished product so closely matched his homebrewed beer.

They're the United Kingdom's most decorated brewery. They devised the extra special bitter (ESB) beer style that has become a perennial favorite of North American craft brewers. Their name is synonymous with traditional British ales. They're one of the few independent London breweries that have managed to survive and thrive while others have faded away. They're Fuller, Smith & Turner, though their products are simply called Fuller's.
This ESB has won more CAMRA awards than any other beer. It was chosen as Britain's best strong ale seven times and was three times selected as the Champion Beer of Britain. The amber ale reveals a rich malt character and is noticeably aggressive on the palate. Many drinkers pick out an orange-citrus essence, which is characteristic of the house yeast. It finishes with a hop bitterness that lingers without harshness.

A deliciously complex dark Belgian ale, Ommegang Abbey bursts with dark fruit and malt aromas, gingerbread spice, a pineapple fruitiness, and a subtle but powerful alcohol warmth. Culturing the house yeast strain will give you the most authentic results, especially at the temperature specified, but a pure culture strain also works well. The caramel red malt, Special B, Belgian chocolate, and dark candi sugar all conspire to produce the deep reddish tint and velvety beige head of this luxurious ale. It takes several weeks of conditioning to attain the proper level of carbonation and dryness in the beer, so be patient—it is well worth it.

We all (well, maybe not all of us) brew a cup of coffee to get us going every morning, so why wouldn't you brew beer with coffee? There are three major factors that affect what flavors you extract from your coffee: grind level, temperature, and contact time. With those factors in mind, it is best to add coffee to your beer one of two ways: you can either add brewed coffee to your beer or steep the coffee beans directly in your beer.
This recipe was inspired by Furthermore Beer's Oscura by putting the flavor of the coffee front and center.

Use a single infusion mash at 149°F (65°C) using a ratio of 1.3 quarts water to 1 pound of grain for the base malt. The sugar is added during fermentation. Brewer Andy Tveekrem says, “The key to making a copy of our 120 Minute IPA is to add hop pellets continuously throughout the 2-hour boil. You will be adding more hops than you think are prudent. Start the main fermentation with the first ale yeast at 72°F (22°C). Two or three days later, prepare a 2-quart starter for the high gravity ale yeast. After the main batch has fermented for several days, or when primary fermentation is about half done, add the high gravity ale yeast. Feed the fermenter twice daily with dextrose that has been liquefied with the fermenting beer. 35 to 40 percent of the overall fermentables should come from dextrose. Feed the sugar for approximately 7 to 14 days. The length of time and the final alcohol level depends on yeast health and temperature. Add yeast nutrient every other day. Monitor the gravity before and after feeding to ensure that not too much sugar is being added. Stop feeding when the yeast can’t take any more, or the beer will end up too sweet. Also add a small charge of hop pellets each day to enhance the hop aroma. This beer will require multiple rackings to clarify. Bottle conditioning is not recommended since the alcohol will inhibit further yeast activity. The final beer should be at least 18% ABV.”","Partial Mash Option:

In London, the brewing industry is growing quickly, just like ours here in the United States. New breweries have transformed London's beer scene, and many of their brewers share a significant trait: they started as members of the London Amateur Brewers (LAB) before going pro. Graham O'Brien, along with other friends from LAB, launched Pressure Drop Brewery at the end of 2012. They started on a 13.2-gallon (50-liter) system in O'Brien's house but soon began to look for a location that would host a 6 to 10 barrel system. Stokey Brown, one of their flagship brews, combines the maltiness of a brown ale with some added hop punch.

In true Burton beer fashion, this beer is largely focused on perfection of water quality alongside traditional English malts and hops.
There's a history behind why people love this beer. There once was a British euphemism, ""gone for a Burton."" It was thought to have originated from a story about a British pilot who didn't return from a mission during the Battle of Britain and was said to have ""gone for a Burton."" It basically suggested he'd stepped out for a beer and may not return after a while. Funny thing...this beer's about the same. It's going to be an investment of your time and your space, but a year later you're going to have what many Americans believe to be a ""smoky IPA"", or a strong ale similar to a pale ale, but much darker and sweeter than India Pale Ale. This English style results in a more sophisticated, mature flavor due to prolonged cellaring that allows special flavors to develop.

Not quite your classic English brown ale, this Christmas Cinderella double comes in at about 6.2% ABV.

This Cranberry Saison Automne was inspired by Unibroue’s Quelque Chose, which is a beer made by blending beer-soaked wild cherries into the final product. The impetus for the cranberries in this recipe was to maximize the fermentation of the sugars by adding them to the mash rather than adding them for flavor at the end.
Frozen cranberries were chosen because the cell walls would be ready to burst so as to get as much flavor as possible, while a relatively cool mash allows for maximum fermentable sugar extraction. The finished product has a flavor very much like a semi-dry white wine with lots of vinous overtones.

Stir in first dose of calcium chloride and gypsum as you mash in. Stir mash every five minutes. (Add heat to keep temperature from dropping.) After 20 minutes, begin checking for conversion with an iodine test. Once test is negative (no starch indicated), or nearly so, collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort from grain bed. (You can do this very quickly; for example, by batch sparging.) If possible, run off wort to your hot liquor tank (HLT). If not, run off to kettle and transfer to your HLT. This wort is your brewing liquor. Heat it to 152° F (67° C). Quickly clean mash tun and combine 15 quarts (14.2 L) brewing liquor with crushed malts and flaked maize to mash at 140° F (60° C). Add second dose of calcium chloride and gypsum. Mash for 30 minutes, then raise temperature to 152° F (67° C). Stir mash when heat is being applied and raise temperature by approximately 2° F (1° C) per minute. (Do not add hot water to raise temperature.) At 10-minute intervals, take a reading of the density of the wort (by refractometer or hydrometer). Record time and specific gravity or Brix. Stir the mash and add heat to maintain mash temperature as needed. Decide when to stop mashing based on the rate of change in wort density. (Eventually, mashing for another 10 minutes will yield only a few extra gravity points.) Heat the mash to 168° F (76° C) for mash out. Recirculate wort until it’s mostly clear and begin running wort off. Use remaining wort from first mash as sparge water (heated so that the grain bed temperature remains near 168° F). Sparge slowly to get as many sugars from the grain bed as possible. Do not use water to sparge at the very end (this will dilute the wort). Collect enough wort for a 90-minute boil. Bring the wort to a boil, and boil for 90 minutes. Add hops with 75 minutes left in boil. Cool to 68° F (20° C) and rack 5 gallons (18.93 L) to fermenter. Aerate the wort thoroughly and pitch the sediment from your yeast starter. (Especially if your OG is over 1.100, aerate for one additional minute eight hours after pitching.) Ferment at 68° F (20° C) until primary fermentation ceases. Rack finished beer to a keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes (4.8 g/L) of CO2.

Doppelbock literally means “double bock.” It is more extreme than a regular bock, but not twice so, with alcohol levels between 7 and 8 percent by volume. Its roots go back to the Paulaner branch of the Benedictine order of monks who were resident friars of the Dukes of Bavaria. Having witnessed strong beer-making in the noble brew houses, they tried their hands at the brew themselves, and soon this new and strong liquid bread became the obvious meal of choice for their frequent fasts.
The doppelbock is a strong, very malty German lager with appreciable alcohol, sweetness, and malt-driven flavors and aromas. Brewed correctly, this beer is an easy-drinker “brewed for holy nourishment,” but it is often overdone, which can make it overly big and alcoholic, so avoid that if you can.

Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine tied with New Belgium's Fat Tire Amber Ale as AHA members' favorite beer in 2006. This delightfully full-bodied barleywine packs about 9.6% in ABV, which not only won it a spot in the Zymurgy's 2006 Best Beers in America, but also in the three years preceding its first place glory.
Sierra Nevada likes to describe the beer as having ""a dense, fruity bouquet; an extremely rich, intense palate; and a deep, reddish-brown color. This ale is superbly balanced between an almost overpowering maltiness and a wonderfully bittersweet hoppiness.""

Harold Gulbransen of QUAFF homebrew club in San Diego, Calif., and Pat McIlhenny Alpine Beer Co., Alpine, Calif., set out to brew a very quaffable IPA for the 2009 National Homebrewers Conference commemorative beer. This IPA recipe can also be found in the May/June 2009 Zymurgy issue.
""Sippin' on the Dock of the Bay IPA,"" brewed by McIlhenny and Gulbransen was inspired by the success of California pro brewers in the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup in the American IPA and Double IPA categories. This is what San Diego brewers like to call a California IPA.
According to Gulbransen, ""Pat, a San Diego Country fire captain (when not brewing beer), is a great brewer and supporter of homebrewing. He has been a longtime member of QUAFF and an overall great guy. This beer will not be a double IPA, but more like an American IPA...a bit more quaffable.""

Combining the smooth taste of a wheat-based beer with the prominent hop characteristics of an American IPA, “white IPA” is a newly emerging franken-style of beer that seems to be growing in popularity.
This recipe, featured in the July/August 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine, is for a clone of Deschutes Brewery Chainbreaker IPA. Here is what Deschutes co-brewmaster Brian Fairve had to say about the recipe:
“Our white IPA malt bills are composed of Pilsner malt, pale wheat malt, and unmalted wheat. We occasionally use flaked oats to add a bit of smooth, creamy mouthfeel. We have also been experimenting with dextrose as an additional carbohydrate source in these beers to increase the ABV and dry them out slightly.
Our hop bill is fairly simplistic—we use Bravo in our first addition for bittering. We don’t really see a point in mid to late kettle hopping for this beer. We really want it to have a nice bitterness with an amazing hop aroma, so we choose to hold off any additional hopping until it enters our hopback. We make up for the lack of hop additions in the kettle by overloading our wort stream with copious amounts of hopback hops.”","Ingredients:
6.5 lb (2.95 kg) Pilsner malt
2.25 lb (1 kg) wheat malt
23 oz (652 g) white unmalted wheat flakes

A decade ago, Jamil Zainasheff wrote an article in the May/June 2006 issue of Zymurgy regarding the delicate art of adding hops late in the boil.
His late-hopping epiphany came to him while drinking Alesmith's Halloween seasonal known as the Evil Dead Red. Zainasheff recalls the beer as having ""substantial malt character, smooth bitterness, luscious mouthfeel, and an evil-looking, almost blood-red color...[with an] amazing hop flavor and aroma from start to finish.""
Zainasheff discovered that the recipe involved adding all but 3–4 IBUs of hops in the last 10 minutes of the boil, as revealed by AleSmith owner Peter Zien. After picking Zien's brain, Jamil came up with his own version of the seasonal he appropriately titled the Evil Twin. This beer is rich and malty, but with a devilishly huge hop aroma and flavor. It's the perfect homebrew recipe for malt lovers and hopheads alike.","Ingredients:

Vinnie Cilurzo says about the groundbreaking Blind Pig IPA:
“Blind Pig IPA was first brewed in Temecula, Calif. at my first brewery, Blind Pig Brewing Company, in 1994. This version was 92 bittering units and had very little malt with a very forward hop character. In December 1996, I left the brewery and my former business partner continued the brewery for a few years. After the original brewery closed and I was at Russian River Brewing Company, we were able to trademark the name and start making Blind Pig IPA again. The recipe has changed, in that we have added a couple of new hop varieties that were not in existence when the brewery in Temecula was open.”

In 2011, Colorado's first brewpub, Wynkoop Brewing Company, teamed up with the American Homebrewers Association to create a dream collaboration beer appropriately named Collective Hoppiness. Quite literally a collective effort, Wynkoop hosted a rally in which the brew's hop additions were continuously added over a 90-minute period by local members of the AHA and 210 members who participated in the hopping of the beer.
Wynkoop describes the beer as “an unctuous imperial red ale made with premium two-row base malt, small amounts of rye, aromatic malts and flaked oats, and five kinds of hops (Summit, Cascade, Sorachi Ace, Amarillo, and Columbus). All fermented with an English ale yeast. Ultra hoppy from start to finish, the beer finished at 8% ABV and has approximately 100 IBUs.” We couldn't help but think that a bunch of hop-lovin' homebrewers would want the opportunity to brew this hoppy masterpiece, so we've scaled it down to a 5-gallon batch for our members' brewing enjoyment.

Though earlier variations of the law were adopted almost half a century before its official enactment on April 23 that year, the law eventually would go into effect across all of Germany.
Among other reasons, the law was originally adopted to control the price of grain used in the brewing process and only allowed brewers to use three ingredients in their beer: water, hops, and barley. The law has since been adapted to modern regulations, but its impact on the history of brewing and beer styles is still renowned today.
In honor of the 500th anniversary of the Reinheitsgebot, the American Homebrewers Association is celebrating its impact by encouraging homebrewers worldwide to brew their choice of two recipes: a Northern German Altbier or a spiced beer.

To brew an extract version of Summertime Ginger Ale homebrew recipe, put 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water in the boil pot and heat to150° F (66° C). While the water is heating, put the Belgian aromatic malt into a grain bag and tie off the ends so the grains can't escape.
Once the water has reached 150° F (66° C), immerse the grain bag in the water for 30 minutes. For more information on steeping specialty grains, visit the Intermediate section of Let's Brew on the AHA website.
After 30 minutes, remove the grain bag and let it drip until it stops. Add the extra light dry malt extract to the water and stir until totally dissolved. Bring to a rolling boil for 60 minutes; add hops, honey, lactose, ginger, and Irish moss at specified intervals from end of boil.
Strain wort into sanitized fermentation vessel with 2–3 gallons (7.6–11.4 L) of pre-boiled and chilled water for a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch yeast when temperature reaches 65° F (18° C). 
After 5 days, rack to secondary fermenter and age for another 10 days, adding remaining ginger for the last 7 days.

Marzen style favors elegance over poundability. It combines a richer, breadier, toastier mélange of malt flavors and aromas, with a darker, fuller body that still is a festively drinkable beer. The light Munich malt will create bread crust complexity, and although the dark Munich toast aromas and flavors can be intense at first, they will blend, mingle and mellow with other malt nuances during lagering.
Marzen also doesn't favor the hop head. You don't want hop aroma, but rather darker toasted and bread crust aromatics of Munich malt that are balanced by the hop bitterness. In the end, we can't imagine why you wouldn't want to give this style a try finishing dry, crisp, balanced and refreshing.","Ingredients:

Soured Fruit Beer (28C) is a new category in the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines, however, this style of brewing is anything but new. Some of the first brew concocted thousands of years ago included local and seasonal fruits and most certainly were sour to some degree. Despite its ancient origins, this style is seeing a renewed birth at the hands of creative brewers around the world.
According to the 2015 guidelines, soured fruit beer can be made from any number of base beer styles and any fruit imaginable, but a couple of key characteristics must be present. First, microbes other than Saccharomyces must be used to contribute a defining “funk” or acidity. Another key attribute is that the flavors and aromas of fruit must be identifiable and must complement the base beer flavor.
Kevin Wright, director of brewing at Hanger 24 in Redlands, California, shares this Sour Blonde with Apricot recipe found in 2015 May/June Zymurgy. Fresh apricots bring the taste of summer to this bright, sour ale. Remember it’s important to plan your brewing and aging correctly to be able to add the fresh apricots at the peak of harvest. Depending on how long your souring process takes, you may need to brew the base beer a year ahead of time. However, your patience will be rewarded!","Ingredients:

After primary fermentation is complete, rack to your aging vessel of choice (shoot for as low oxygen permeability as possible to limit acetic acid) and add Brett/bacteria blend.

Their philosophy was if they couldn't buy it, they could sure try and make it, thereby banding together to create the Maltose Falcons, America's oldest homebrew club.
To honor the club's achievement in hitting 40, Allen Tracy, another club member, was visiting family up the Central Coast of California. He stopped by Firestone Walker Brewing in Paso Robles and chatted up brewmaster Matt Brynildson, who invited the club to come brew any beer recipe they wanted with them. (Lesson of the day: Always ask award winning brewers if you can brew with them - they sometimes say yes!).
The club board, led by Steve Cook, developed a homebrew recipe for a barleywine-strength brown ale aged in rum barrels that was called browneywine. More than 40 members made the 3.5 hour trek to the brewery and were given a run of the brewery, anxiously waiting to enjoy the 40th anniversary party in October to taste the Browneywine.","Ingredients:

The Old Rasputin brand image is a drawing of Rasputin, a Russian peasant, mystical faith healer and a trusted friend to the family of Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia, with a phrase in Russian encircling it - A sincere friend is not born instantly.
Old Rasputin clone, found in July/August 2007 Zymurgy and created by Amahl Turczyn, is a huge, complex beer, heavy on flavor and aroma, with lots of warming alcohol. It will age well, but with lots of late hops, you may want to let it condition for only a month or so.
As with any high-gravity beer, pitch double the yeast you normally would - it's a great beer to pitch the dregs of another beer into. The California ale yeast does very well with this beer, and can handle the extra-high gravity. The grain bitterness is controlled very well with the use of dark crystal and brown malts to temper the roast and chocolate. The first sip might not be too friendly, but sincere friends are not born instantly.","Ingredients:

When Old Man Winter comes knocking at the door, it helps to have a warming, malty doppelbock beer in hand. Doppelbocks are strong, dark beers that were drunk by eleventh-century Bavarian monks to help sustain themselves during winter fasts. These creamy bocks ensured that the monks would fast frequently.
Gordon Biersch’s Winter Bock is a classic, dark doppelbock that delivers a well-rounded, earthy malt profile and, despite the higher alcohol content, is deceptively drinkable. It’s not quite as full-bodied as some other doppelbocks, but what Winter Bock lacks in strength, it makes up for in taste. As the cold months approach, the Winter Bock, with its earthy, malty backbone, is the perfect comfort drink on a cold night.","Ingredients:

Sierra Nevada’s Celebration ale is a two-fold celebration–it’s released just in time for the holiday season and a festive event for the first fresh hops of the season–and you can brew your own at home!
Found in July/August 2003 Zymurgy, this Celebration recipe Ale is a hop-head’s dream; swimming with hop flavor on a pleasant malt base, it will turn away the uninitiated, but thrill those with a taste of lupulin. Like many great beers, it is as simple as it is good.
First brewed in 1981, it is one of the earliest examples of an American IPA, and one of the few, but very welcomed, hop-forward holiday beers. Its intense citrus-pine aromas and grapefruit flavors are a treat for the colder weather months when beers get thicker and darker. Honoring everything about Sierra Nevada, here’s our crack at an all-grain version with a well-tested extract recipe below.","Ingredients:

Michael Tonsmiere, the Mad Fermentationist, and his friend, Alex Howe, set out to create a series of beers to celebrate dried fruit and cold weather.
The Dark Winter Saison IV, found in May/June 2014 Zymurgy with some of its flavors inspired by Russian River’s Consecration, a dark ale aged in cabernet sauvignon barrels for 4 to 8 months with black currants and souring microbes. The Dark Winter Saison IV is similar, aged in currants and a wine-soaked oak stave that helps it become rich and vinous.
The beers smells of dank Brett funk, with raisin aromatics from the currants and some red wine as well. As it warms, you might notice vanilla from the oak. It’s a dry beer, but not too much so. It should taste lightly tart, with minimal bitterness and a slight warming alcohol feel.

The west coast IPA started off as a local trend, and has emerged as an perpetually-evolving style defined by brash bitterness, intense hoppiness, and rather high alcohol by volume.
Although there are many notable beers that are dubbed ""west coast IPAs,"" the Green Flash West Coast IPA recipe clone, found in the July/August 2013 issue of Zymurgy by Amahl Turczyn, Associate Editor of Zymurgy, embodies the style perfectly. After all, Green Flash trademarked the term ""West Coast IPA"" and slapped it on their label.
The plethora of hops creates a layered drinking experience of bitterness and hop-forward flavor and aroma. The additions of Simcoe and Centennial give off tropical grapefruit and piney notes respectively, while the Cascade hops add some floral quality to compliment the spicy citrus notes of the Columbus and Amarillo hops.
With an assertive flavor and grapefruit bitterness held up by crystal malt, it's a beer of extremes — overdoing things just because they wanted to. And you should to!","Ingredients:

Scott says, “Alternatively, one could bottle after the diacetyl rest in lieu of kegging.” “I typically wouldn’t use any specialty malts when conducting the traditional decoction mash. If you have the time, it’s worth the effort—but with modern malts, one can make a decent Pilsner using an infusion or step mash.” “I’m also blessed with naturally soft water, so brewers should take a good look at their water profile and either dilute with distilled or RO water, or lower the hop additions if they have significant sulfate levels.” “By the way, the Chodsko is a scenic region that borders Germany in western Bohemia.”","Extract Version

While attending the Brewers Association's SAVOR event in Washington, D.C., Charlie tried a rosemary-infused IPA called Rosemary Swamp Fox IPA.
John Pinkerton, owner and brewmaster of the Moon River Brewing Co. in Savannah, Ga., poured Charlie a taste. At first he experienced what seemed to be a new hop character in the aroma and flavor, but instead it was the delicate character of fresh rosemary.
Charlie tinkered with the amount of rosemary in his homebrew version, and transformed the recipe from an IPA to a pale ale using a recipe he found in the January/February 2012 Zymurgy. The goal was to give the beer a hint of rosemary that can be mistaken for an exotic hop character, while exploring the mouthfeel and nuances that oats create. He also added a little agave to lighten up the body and a touch of caramel.","Ingredients:

To brew the Delirium Oat Rosemary Pale Ale recipe, a step infusion mash is employed to mash the grains. Add 9.5 quarts (9 L) of 140°F (60°C) water to the crushed grain (but not the oatmeals and cup of pale malt), stir, stabilize and hold the temperature at 132°F (53°C) for 30 minutes. Add quick oatmeal and 1 cup crushed pale malt to 6.25 quarts (4.5 L) of water and bring to a boil. When malt mash has finished its 30 minute rest, add the boiling hot “oatmeal” water to the mash, bring temperature up to 155°F (68°C) and hold for about 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 167°F (75°C), lauter and sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.5 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Collect about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of runoff. Add 60 minute hops and agave syrup and bring to a full and vigorous boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30 minute hops. When 10 minutes remains, add 10-minute hops and Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes. Continue to chill in the immersion or use other methods to chill your wort. Strain and sparge the wort into a sanitized fermenter. Bring the total volume to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with additional cold water if necessary. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Ferment at about 70°F (21°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets and rosemary for dry hopping. If you have the capability, cellar the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week.

0.75 cup (175 ml) corn sugar (priming bottles) or 0.33 cup (80 ml) corn sugar for kegging]
Directions:
To brew the Delirium Oat Rosemary Pale Ale Recipe, heat 2 quarts (2 L) water to 172°F (77.5°C) and add crushed grains and quick oats to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155°F (68°C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes, add heat to the min-mash and raise the temperature to 167°F (75°C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170°F (77°C) water. Discard the grains.
Add more water to the sweet extract you have just produce, bring the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Add malt extract, agave syrup, and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 30 minutes remain, add the 30-minute hops. When 10 minutes remain, add the 10-minute hops and Irish moss. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes, turn off the heat. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15-30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple of homebrews.
Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of cold water has been added. If necessary add cold water to achieve a 5.5 gallon (21 L) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70°F (21°C). Ferment at about 70°F (21°C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of clam and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets and rosemary for dry hopping. If you have the capability, cellar the beer at about 55°F (12.5°C) for about one week. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete."

Lagunitas' Little Sumpin Sumpin is nothing short of delicious.

All the hops starting with the letter ""C"" are used in this beer, but the bitterness still remains low enough not to wreck your palate.
It pours bright orange to copper in color, with grapefruit and orange aromas tingling your nose. After your first sip, you'll experience some citrusy hops along with earthy hops before it smooths out in a creamy and slightly bitter finish.

Chris Wane shared his ""Oh My Eye! Grapefruit Hefeweizen"" in the 2008 January/February Zymurgy. Whether he knew grapefruit would go so well with hefeweizen's clove, banana profile and zesty carbonation is irrelevant, because this beer is sure to leave you wanting more.
This citrusy, fruit beer is complex and refreshing with a rather low alcohol content. With just a little over an ounce of hops used throughout the brewing process, this beer has minimal bitterness and subtle aromas of flower and spice fragrances. This hefeweizen will make your head spin with it's snappy and effervescent, citrusy and spicy complexity. Add in the grapefruit, and you're sure to create something unique and surprising that you might not be so willing to share.","Ingredients:

Dough in at 1.25 quarts per gallon to hit 125°F (52°C). Hold for 15 minutes, then pull 35 to 38 percent of mash out for decoction. Bring decoction up to 156°F (69°C) and hold for 15 minutes, then raise to a boil and boil for 15 minutes. Add back to main mash to hit 156°F (69°C) and hold for 45 minutes. Remove 20 to 23 percent for a second decoction. Bring decoction to a boil and boil for 15 minutes, then add back to main mash to hit mash out at 168°F (76°C) and hold for 10 minutes. Collect enough wort for a 2.25 hour boil. Chill beer to 48-49°F (9°C) and transfer to fermenter, keep the wort as clean of trub as possible. Oxygenate well. Consult Mr. Malty to calculate the correct yeast-to-wort ratio needed. Begin your starter one week ahead of time at 68-70°F (20-21°C). The day before you brew, drop starter down to 48-49°F (9°C). After your wort is cooled to 48-49°F (9°C), pour off as much of the spent starter as possible without losing any yeast. Add some of your wort from fermenter and swirl to get the yeast in suspension and add to your fermenter. In nine to 12 days, when fermentation is about 70 percent done, raise fermenter temperature to 60-62°F (16-17°C) for a four to five day diacetyl rest. After this, fermentation should be complete. Transfer to kegs and lager for two and a half to three months at 32-34°F (0-1°C). I like to go to a secondary for a month before I keg to let the beer clear up. This doppelbock was nine months old when submitted for judging at the NHC. Primary fermentation at 48-50°F (9-10°C). Forced CO2 to carbonate (2-2.4 vol.).","Extract Option

Single infusion mash for 90 minutes at 156°F (68°C) with a water/grain ratio of 1.25 gallon per pound. Drain and sparge to collect 7.25 gallons (27 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes.

Chill to 66°F (19°C) and ferment with an appropriately sized starter of WLP380. After krausen begins to fall (four to five days), allow temperature to free rise to 70°F (21°C) and continue fermenting until complete. Please rouse the yeast. This is NOT a krystal weizenbock. Bottle conditioning is a must for the style. Bottle and prime with enough DME to produce 3 volumes of carbonation. This ale requires patience for the rich malt and dried fruit flavors to mature, so age at cellar temperature for several months to reach optimum flavor. Primary fermentation for four to five days at 66°F (19°C). Secondary fermentation for seven days at 70°F (21°C). DME to carbonate to 3 vol. CO2.","Extract Option

In 2008, homebrewer-turned-pro Patrick Rue opened The Bruery in Orange County, CA. He started to play around with witbier recipes, and created a classic style wit, as well as this opaque and rich Black Orchard Wit. This recipe was featured in the May/June 2009 Zymurgy article, ""Seeing the Light: Belgian Session Beers.""
Witbiers are a brewer's playground. For one, fruits and spices pop from its sweet, bready profile. Also, the beer descends from gruit ales—an old herb mixture used to bitter and flavor beer. Now, your spice collection suddenly has a little more purpose. For example, clove, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon will give a numbing sensation that cuts sweetness. Try using spelt or other grains for some of the wheat to play with the flavor profile.
In the end, a witbier should bring the full experience of Belgium and still allow you coherently hold a conversation. So, when the mid-week beer craving hits or you're planning out a brew day, oft for a refreshing, light witbier ale instead.","Ingredients:

Homebrewers in Poland are making some incredibly high-quality, world-class beers and are turning heads all over the world. In June 2013, a five-judge panel from Austria, Belgium, England, Germany and the United States chose Czeslaw Dzielak's Imperial IPA as grand champion in Poland's largest homebrew contest, Konkurs Piw Domowych Birofilia.
When Czeslaw Dzielak's Imperial IPA won best of show at Birofilia 2013, none of the other homebrewers appeared surprised. Tomasz Rogaczewski, co-founder of Pracownia Piwa (Poland), explained that was because everybody expected Dzielak to have won already. He had brewed over 250 batches of beer and was an eminent figure in the homebrewing community. Later that year, Zywiec Brewery released Brackie Grand Champion Birofilia 2013 Imperial IPA, made using Dzielak's recipe. Talk about a great year! He then earned a second straight grand champion award at Birofilia 2014 with his dubbel.
The 32-year-old Dzielak teaches history and physical education at a secondary technical school. He's written a business plan and acquired some of the necessary licensing, but still needs investor financing if he is to open his own brewery. Should he succeed, we're sure the other competitors in Polish homebrew contests may well be as happy about it as he is. Now, as they say in Polish ""Juz pora zaczynac warzenie domowe!""

Drew Beechum, AHA Governing Committee shares this Bastage English Summer Ale in his article “Express Brewing: From Grain to Glass in 6 Days” found in 2011 November/December Zymurgy issue.
It’s an ale and made for summer consumption. What else is there to say? Inspired by the hoppy ales of southeastern England, this is a beer that explodes with a refreshing taste from its earliest age. It will have some hop presence that plants its bitterness in the English pale ales of today, but brings along a rich complexity of soft citrus and resinous aromas. Balanced with the reduced maltiness and white wheat malt, this beer has a great balance that keeps things light and sessionable.
If you’re a hop-lover, this beer has a different framing than the standard pale ale or IPA with an end result that invites you to have another (and another).","Ingredients:

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/nazz-session-ipa/,Not Found,"IPA is king in the craft beer world. However, for the hophead who likes to have a few pints and still walk away, the session IPA is a wonderful thing. It gives you a bitter slap in the face and a rich hop blast on your tongue, without the expected buzz of a full-strength IPA. It matches a pale ale (or lower) strength beer, but is lighter in malt and meaner in hops.
Drew Beechum, Vice Chair of the AHA Governing Committee and Chip Walton of Chop & Brew and member of the AHA Governing Committee, developed a session IPA recipe by modifying Drew's Pliny the Toddler Session IPA recipe found in 2013 July/August Zymurgy magazine. The result? Bright, clear and crisp with a cracker-grain finish. The aroma is dense and herbal with tropical notes, while the malt gets slammed by the bitterness that rides through until the end.

Homebrewing enthusiasts are becoming more and more interested in sour beer. However, the amount of aging required can be daunting. How can you replicate a beer aged in large oak casks in your glass carboys or plastic buckets?
Another issue is fermenting your beer with bacteria or mixed cultures. There's a threat of cross-contamination if the same equipment is used to make a conventional beer. Investing in another set of brewing equipment is a painful idea.
Matt Lange, a freelance writer and award-winning homebrewer from Madison, Wisconsin, shares his wort souring method by creating a sour starter, which will save you time, give you more control over the level of acidity in the final product, and eliminate the threat of cross-contamination. However, it might lack the complexity of slow aging sour beers. But just like many sour beers, it can create surprising results!

Mash at a lower temperature 148-150°F (64-66°C). Souring: After the mash, bring the wort to a boil, then cool to 100°F (38°C). Inoculate using either a commercial culture of Lactobacillus or a homemade sour starter (see below) culture as describe below. Try to keep the wort warm during the souring period (placing the wort back into a picnic cooler-type mash tun works great for this). Let it sour for 18 hours, then boil 90 minutes, adding your bittering hops at 60 minutes. Ferment at around 68°F (20°C). Sour Starter: Three days before brew day, take a small amount of malt and add it to a solution of warm water and sugar (malt extract or table sugar works). A few tablespoons of malt placed in a pint of low gravity sugar solution (around 1.030 OG) should be a good sour starter for a 5 gallon (18.93 L) batch. Allow it to sit for three days at around 100°F (38°C), which helps create a better culture than simply adding malt to the wort or mash. It utilizes the pH tolerances of different bacteria to isolate the good ones from the bad ones. By the third day, your sour starter is ready to be used to inoculate the wort. Continue with your brew day as you normally would.","Extract Option

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/2015-big-brew-recipe-3-killer-kolsch/,Not Found,"National Homebrew Day was announced before Congress on May 7, 1988. The American Homebrewers Association (AHA) created AHA Big Brew as an annual event to celebrate National Homebrew Day around the world. AHA Big Brew is held each year on the first Saturday in May.
The 2015 AHA Big Brew recipes come from three time AHA Ninkasi Award winner and current BJCP President, Gordon Strong! This year’s beers are all medal-winning recipes from Gordon’s upcoming book, Modern Homebrew Recipes, to be released in May 2015.
If you are looking for a way to put a twist on this Kolsch recipe, take a tip from AHA Director, Gary Glass: “I recently got together with some fellow Brewers Association staff members to brew a Kolsch. Inspired by a local brewery, we decided to make a coffee variation of the Kolsch by making a concentrated batch of cold-steeped coffee that we then put in a condiment dispenser. By adding variable doses of the coffee concentrate to a glass of Kolsch, we could customize our coffee Kolsch to our own tastes.”
From Modern Homebrew Recipes: “I fell in love with this style after a visit to Cologne in 2006. I had enjoyed it before, but it didn’t seem like anything special. Trying it fresh made all the difference… The style allows for subtle changes in balance in several components (malt, hop flavor, bitterness, fruitiness), but all were hovering around moderate intensity. I won a number of NHC first round medals with this recipe, which is in the style of a Früh or Reissdorf.”","Ingredients:

Gose (proununced gose-uh) is an obscure beer style to many. Emerging out of Goslar, Germany, gose is brewed with wheat malt, fermented with ale yeast and flavored with coriander and salt. It has a light sourness like a Berliner weisse and was more than likely wildly fermented, like Belgian lambic beers.
Although sour brewing can be risky to brewing equipment, there are several methods laid out in the article ""Gose"" found in the 2015 March/April Zymurgy issue, as well as general souring knowledge in Michael Tonsmiere's American Sour Beers.
Gose is a rarity, and homebrewers have the advantage of brewing beer styles that are hard to find on shelves. The recipe below is a homage to Rittergutsbrauerei Döllnitz's gose. Try it out and let us know what you think!

Reserve 14 of the 16 ounces of milled, acidulated malt. Mash the remaining 2 ounces acid malt with Pilsner and Wheat malts, along with rice hulls at 149°F (65°C) and hold for 45 minutes. Add remaining acid malt and continue to mash, stirring every 15 minutes, for another 45 minutes. Don’t worry if mash temperature falls slightly during secondary mash. Add heat to bring the mash temperature up to 168°F (76°C) and sparge at this temperature until runoff wort gravity reaches 1.008 (2° P) or pH 5.8 (whichever comes first). Collect enough wort in the kettle to allow for a final volume of 5.5 gallons after a 60 minute boil. Use fresh, whole coriander seed ground in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, and add 5 minutes before the end of the boil. Chill to 70°F (21°C), aerate and pitch. Ferment at 68°F (20°C) until terminal gravity is reached. Crash to 40°F (4°C) and cold condition for one week, then rack. Add salt and lactic acid to taste, blending thoroughly. Two ounces of lactic acid at bottling (along with the acid malt contribution from the mash) will result in a mildly tart gose, whereas 3 ounces will be noticeably tart. Package and carbonate or bottle and prime. Note: If adding gyle, sugar or malt extract to prime, be sure to taste for the correct acid and salinity balance before blending in priming.","Extract Option
Directions:
Substitute 6.9 lb (3.12 kg) wheat malt extract syrup for the pilsner and wheat malt. Omit rice hulls and acid malt. Dissolve extracts completely and proceed with boil. Note that color may be slightly darker (5.3 SRM) with the extract recipe, and more lactic acid will likely be needed at bottling to achieve the same level of tartness. Also due to the omission of acid malt in the mash, acidity might be somewhat one-dimensional compared with the all-grain version."

Newcastle Brown Ale, called simply “Newkie” by many fans, is actually a blend of two beers. Brewers blend a strong, dark ale that’s been aged with a younger, amber ale. The result? An average-strength brown ale that comes in full and malty with an ever-so-slight dark fruity aroma and butterscotch flavor, and balanced with hop bitterness for a refreshing, dry finish. So it’s no coincidence homebrewers have come up with many Newcastle Brown Ale clone recipes.

Perfect for a dark and stormy night, Drew Beechum's ""My Smoked Dark Heart"" is a smoked black lager with soft roasted notes and a malt body resting somewhere between Pilsner crisp and Bock maltiness. As Drew would warn you, don't depend on English-style chocolate and black patent malts for deep blackness. The beer will have an overabundance of roast and not taste like a lager. He recommends Weyermann's line of Carafa® chocolate malts, as well as Carafa Special malt because the husk is taken away to remove aggressive flavors and roast acidity. To Drew, the Carafa Special tastes like dark toffee blended with your favorite mild coffee.

Jeff Neggemeyer of Longmont, Colo., took home a gold medal during the 2002 National Homebrew Competition in the Bitter and English Pale Ale category with this extra special bitter recipe.
If you're looking for a beer with malt up front and hops right behind it, look no further. This strong bitter comes up with a nice floral and hop aroma from the Centennial and Cascade hops that complements the 19 pounds of rich maltiness. The beer's well balanced hops and malt flavor give it great drinkability.
And if that isn't enough for you, this style is known for finishing well with appropriate warmth and hop bitterness. It has a medium to full body and the 10 pounds of forced CO2 give it the appropriate amount of carbonation. One judge from the 2002 NHC believed this beer had ""no major flaws."" In a word, it's wonderful. But don't take our word for it, try it for yourself!","Ingredients:

Chris O'Brien is a homebrewer with a mission. As co-owner of Seven Bridges organic brew supplies and author of Fermenting Revolution: How to Drink Beer and Save the World, O'Brien takes homebrewing to the next level by promoting the use of responsibly cultivated, organic ingredients.
""Making organic homebrew is no different than making regular homebrew,"" shared O'Brien in his article ""Organic Fermentation is Sweeping the Nation"" (March/April 2009 Zymurgy). ""Just start with fresh, organic ingredients and the rest is the art and science of homebrewing--same as usual. The one big challenege is finding those ingredients.""

After visiting Bohemian Brewery in Salt Lake City, Charlie Papazian had a hankering for the subtle complexity and thirst-quenching satisfaction of a Vienna-style lager, but already had plans to brew a tried-and-try English mild ale. In true homebrew fashion, Charlie decided to combine the best of both worlds to create Sweet Mischief Vienna-Mild.
Here is what Charlie had to say about the recipe in the May/June 2012 issue of Zymurgy magazine:
""The unique roast character of the brown malt and the caramel sweetness of the crystal m alt along with lower gravity represent mild ale-ness. The generous amount of mellow, toasty Munich malt along with neutral base Pilsner malt heads in the direction of a Vienna lager. Belgian aromatic malt always contributes a great goosing if rich malt aroma and flavor is desired. The small amount of Belgian aromatic malt is subtle and has kind of a catalytic effect, helping emphasize the Munich and Crystal.
Dry hopping with Crystal hops imparts an aromatic character appropriate to both English ales and German lagers. I wanted to give this beer a lager-like emphasis in bitterness and flavor, so I used German Hallertauer in the long bittering boil and American Mt. Hood to contribute a honey and floral-like flavor, though with a 45-minute boil most of that character is minimized. The overall balance of this beer emphasized subtlety yet offers satisfaction in those thirst and sessionable occasions.""","Ingredients:

In many ways Düsseldorf altbier is the essence of a hybrid beer. The term “alt” refers to an old German style of brewing using ale yeasts, before bottom fermenting yeasts were widely available. Fermentation temperatures are kept on the cooler end of the ale spectrum, creating many of the smooth characteristics found in lagers but with an ale yeast.
The medium bodied ale showcases the richness of specialty malts while allowing for noticeable bitterness to make an appearance. Altbier is a great style to session for both malt and hop heads alike.

Maibocks, or helles bocks, are traditionally served in the spring, specifically in May, throughout Germany. Often described as a Munich helles with bock strength, or as a paler take on the classic bock style, Maibocks offer the malty notes and strength characteristic of a bock, along with slightly more pronounced hop aroma than your typical bock.
However, Charlie specifically notes “American homebrewers, be careful. I am not granting you license to over hop this beer.”
With lighter, paler notes, a nice alcoholic strength, and lager crispness, this Maibock is begging to be the start to those warm May nights that lie ahead. Get to brewing this recipe now, and you’ll be glad when you have a cold glass of Jabberwocky Maibock to help chase down a late afternoon spring sunset.","Ingredients:

If you’re looking for a traditional Irish beer for your St. Patrick's Day party that is sessionable and less intimidating than the rich, dark aura of a dry Irish stout, then a red ale is just the thing. With low hop character and sweet, caramel malt flavors that shine through in the forefront, it is sure to be a crowd pleaser with your friends who fear “the black stuff.""
This recipe comes from author Mark Pasquinelli’s article on Irish Red Ales in the March/April 2009 issue of Zymurgy magazine. Mark describes it as “the ultimate session beer: not to dark, alcoholic, malty or bitter—a metaphor in moderation”, even capable of bridging gaps between stout snobs and light lager lovers.
Pasquinelli notes that this recipe, even with additional fermentation time to ward off diacytel, is ready in about a month. Brew some today and have it ready for your St. Paddy’s Day celebration . Sláinte!","Ingredients:

SRM: 43
Boil Time: 90 minutes","Directions:
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 151°F (66°C). Hold the mash at 151°F (66°C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring, or with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to mash out at 168°F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170°F (77°C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.052 (12.9°P).
The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add lactose and Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left. Chill the wort to 68°F (20°C) and aerate thoroughly. Use 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5 liter starter.
Ferment at 68°F (20°C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. At this point you have an excellent milk stout. To make the chai milk stout you will need to add a tincture of chai spices.
Chris explains, “For the chai spice, I simply take a cheap vodka and soak our house chai spice mixture in it, then add small doses to a keg until it tastes right. I try to make a very strong spice tincture so there is only a negligible amount of vodka added to the beer. Usually it only takes 0.4 oz of tincture to spice 5 gallons of beer. Frankly, I am not certain what is in our chai spice mixture, but I am sure your favorite chai spice mix will work great. Make additions slowly and taste as you go so you can hit it just right.”","Extract Version

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/falconclaws-samichlaus/,Not Found,"What do you think Old St. Nick drinks after a tough night of squeezing down chimneys? It would have to be something strong enough to calm his nerves after an evening of globetrotting, but quaffable enough to beg another sip.
Samichlaus, once the strongest beer in the world at 14% ABV, came to be in 1979 when Swiss-based Hürlimann Brewery decided to brew a Christmas lager on December 6—St. Nicholas Day (feast day). Until its doors closed in 1997, Hürlimann Brewery produced Samichlaus every year on December 6, and built up a loyal fan base along the way.
Samichlaus, the Swiss-German name for Saint Nicholas, is an enormous dopplebock weighing in at 1.140 specific gravity that undergoes nearly a year of lagering before being bottled and enjoyed in the following year’s holiday season. Despite the founding breweries closure, this festive lager was able to live on through homebrewers and eventually another commercial brewery, Braurei Schloss Eggenberg, in 2000.
Drew Beechum describes how his homebrew club, the Maltose Falcons, turned December 6 into their own Samichlaus tradition:
“The Falcons had a long love affair with Samichlaus since we have quite a few guys who specialize in lagers. They would get together every year and taste the vintages. Just before I joined the club, though, Hürlimann Brewery closed down —no more Samichlaus.
Kevin Baranowski and the rest of the crew eventually decided that this just wouldn’t stand, so every December we got together and brewed a scant 5.5 gallons of the brew. Over the years we tried a number of lager yeasts and Kevin shepherded the beer through its near year of fermenting at lager temps. We finally nailed the beer in all of its strong sweet massively potent glory when White Labs released the “Zurich Lager” strain.
The best way to do it—brew a smaller beer ahead of time and use the entire yeast cake, all of it, to get the fermentation down to the right gravity. When you’re dealing with a 1.140 starting gravity you need all the help you can get!”","Ingredients:

This recipe appears in the article, ""Rogue Ale Brewery: Pirate of the Amber Waves,"" in the September/October 2003 issue of Zymurgy magazine.
Author of the article, Amahl Turczyn, worked with Rogue's John Maier and Lou Bank to forumulate the Dead Guy Ale clone recipe along with eleven other Rogue clones for homebrewers to try out.
Though Rogue's proprietary Pacman yeast is challenging to obtain, you can still get a close replication of one of Rogue's flagship brews with this recipe!","Ingredients:
8.0 lb (3.6 kg) Great Western 2-row pale malt
2.0 lb (0.9 kg) Munich malt
1.0 lb (0.45 kg) 15° L crystal malt
1.0 oz (28 g) Perle pellet hops, 8% alpha acid (90 min)
0.5 oz (14 g) Saaz pellet hops, 4.3% alpha acid (10 min)
1.0 tps (5 ml) Irish moss (20 min)
BrewTek California Pub Ale (CL-50) yeast or equivalent*
*BrewTek is no longer in business, making CL-50 difficult to obtain. There are yeast banks with CL-50 available, but it may take some time and effort to procure. Wyeast 1450, aka Denny's Favorite 50, is a similar yeast to the CL-50 and can be used. Wyeast released the elusive Rogue Pacman Yeast (1764) as part of there Private Collection, which can be tracked down at some homebrew shops, but it comes and goes. Some homebrewers have harvested cultures from unfilitered Rogue brews as well. Depending on what yeast strains are available and/or your yeast-harvesting skills, a decision on the proper yeast will have to be made accordingly.

This recipe comes courtesey of Charlie Papazian’s article “Not-So Pilsener” in the November/December 2005 issue of Zymurgy magazine (vol. 28.6). Here is what Charlie had to say about his beer:
“Not-So Pilsener was a memorable discovery of the unique character that late hopping with French Strisselspalt hops brought to my brew. Not a traditional Pilsener, this 20-percent rice lager is a variation on a theme, such was the desire to lighten the body without compromising malt and hop character. I’ve brewed a similar recipe in years past with great success, but this time I bumped up the rice from 10 to 20 percent and played around with the delicate nature of American Mt. Hood and French Strisselspalt hops….
…As the beer was consumed over a period of time, the intensity [of Strisseltpalt’s unique flavors] did not diminish. Always there to awaken the floral fruity joy of sweet apricot, quickly to recede, giving way to noble hop flavor and bitterness of Mt. Hood hops and a Not-So Pilsener enjoyed in the hot months of summer or the crisp of winter ” (p. 52-53)","Ingredients:

This recipe is featured in Stan Hieronymus' article ""Amateurs, Pros Connect at GABF"" in the January/February 2007 issue of Zymurgy magazine.
In October 2005, Tom Nolan brewed a Baltic porter that would go on to be one of his most successful beers to date. At a monthly homebrew competition held by the Winston-Salem WortHawgs, Nolan's recipe was chosen by Foothills Brewing to scale up and brew in their facility. Small adjustments were made to the homebrew recipe, resulting in a higher gravity and slightly lower IBU, but it was still noticeably Nolan's creation.
After spending a hard day brewing with the Foothills crew in June 2006, which to Nolan's surprise was quite similar to his homebrewing routine (complete with boil-over), the beer sat in fermenters getting ready for competition. The collaborative effort of Nolan and Foothills Brewing was rewarded with a gold medal at the 2006 GABF Pro-Am Competition as well as silver in the Baltic porter category in that year's commercial competition.","Ingredients:

Ferment at about 70o F (21o C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Prepare the hop oil by using a pipette to carefully add 2 drops of oil into a sanitized beer glass into which you’ve added about 1 tablespoon (about 15 ml) of grain alcohol or 100+ proof vodka/neutral spirits. Swirl and blend oil into alcohol. Add about 4 oz of cheap light lager beer to further disperse oil into mixture. Add dispersed oil/beer/alcohol mixture into your secondary fermenter and then rack beer from primary into the secondary.

Directions:
Heat 5.5 quarts (5.2 l) water to 172o F (77.5o C) and add crushed grains and oats to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155o F (68o C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 60 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167o F (75o C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170o F (77o C) water. Discard the grains.
Add to the sweet extract you have just produced more water, bringing the volume to about 2.75 gallons (10.5 l). Add malt extract, rapadura sugar and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil. The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add the Irish moss. When 5 minute remains add the 5-minute hops. After a total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat and place the pot (with cover on) in a running cold-water bath for 30 minutes.

Dubbel’s are characterized as medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale with a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma. It tastes sweet up front, but finishes dry. This is because of the layering of the specialty grains (usually CaraMunich or Special B). The dry finish also is attained by mashing at a lower temperature than you typically would for a sweeter beer. It is also a great beer for brewers that are just starting to brew all grain. However you can create an extract that is comparable using Munich or Amber extract or even a little corn sugar to increase the original gravity.

0.75 cup (175 ml) or 0.33 cup (80 ml)
corn sugar (priming bottles) or corn sugar (kegging)
DIRECTIONS
Heat 1.25 gallons (4.75 l) water to 172 °F (77.5 °C) and add crushed grains to the water. Stir well to distribute heat. Temperature should stabilize at about 155 °F (68 °C). Wrap a towel around the pot and set aside for about 45 minutes. Have a homebrew.
After 45 minutes add heat to the mini-mash and raise the temperature to 167 °F (75 °C). Pass the liquid and grains into a strainer and rinse with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Discard the grains.
Add to the sweet extract you have just produced more water, bringing the volume up to about 2.5 gallons (9.5 l). Add malt extract and 60 minute hops and bring to a boil.
The total boil time will be 60 minutes. When 10 minutes remain add Irish moss. When 1 minute remains add the 1-minute hops. After total wort boil of 60 minutes turn off the heat. Immerse the covered pot of wort in a cold water bath and let sit for 15-30 minutes or the time it takes to have a couple homebrews. Strain out and sparge hops and direct the hot wort into a sanitized fermenter to which 2.5 gallons (9.5 l) of cold water has been added. If necessary add cold water to achieve a 5.5 gallon (21 l) batch size. Aerate the wort very well.
Pitch the yeast when temperature of wort is about 70 °F (21 °C). Once visible signs of fermentation are evident ferment at termperatures of about 55 °F (12.5 °C) for about one week or when fermentation shows signs of calm and stopping. Rack from your primary to a secondary and add the hop pellets for dry hopping. Lager the beer at temperatures between 35-45 °F (1.5-7 °C) for 4 to 8 weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle or keg when complete.

Original Gravity: 1.057 (14.0°P)
Final Gravity: 1.005 (1.3°P)
ABV: 7%
SRM: 22","Directions:
This is a blend of two beers, refermented with grape juice concentrate from a 1-gallon winemaking kit.
The first beer is a Flanders red–style ale. Mash 60 min. at 152°F (67°C). The only hop addition is 2 oz. of low-alpha Strisselspalt at 60 min. Chill to pitching temperature of about 70°F (21°C), and pitch House and/or Roeselare blend of microbes. Primary 30 days in an HDPE container. (Some natural oxygen ingress through the HDPE during primary is desirable for the style.) Secondary at least 6 months, or as much as 18 months in stainless steel.
Mash: You can alter the mash temperature higher or lower. Because this recipe calls for a blend of Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus, all sugars will be metabolized in time. A lower mash temperature will mean more easily digestible sugars for the Saccharomyces and a cleaner beer. A higher mash temperature means more longer chain sugars and more influence from the non-Saccharomyces microbes.
Hops: You can use different hops, as Strisselspalt is not always available. I recommend a variety with a floral or herbal aroma, and keep the IBUs around 10. More IBUs than that may inhibit Lactobacillus, which is the primary souring microbe.
Microbes: My Flanders red lives in a 10-gallon stainless steel keg, which is a single-vessel solera. Every year, I remove 5 gal. from the tank to blend into a final product and replace the removed volume with 5 gal. of new beer I make after I let it primary in the HDPE. (Let the microbes settle in primary and rack; you don’t want the yeast cake in the solera keg to increase every year).
The microbes in my solera are a house blend that gets more complicated with each yearly cycle. At this point, it includes wild-caught yeast, which I isolated from a homebrewed, spontaneously fermented lambic-style ale; commercial blends from various yeast labs; and bottle dregs from commercial sours and wild ales. If you use bottle dregs, make sure they aren’t from breweries that pasteurize or use a killer strain to bottle condition. The Milk the Funk Wiki has a list of breweries whose bottles have good dregs for this purpose.
I recommend a solera, as the product you will have for blending becomes fractionally more mature and complex each year. I am on year 5 of my solera, and in my opinion the product now rivals my favorite commercial sour ales. However, you don’t need a solera to make a great sour. My favorite commercial blend for this style is Roeselare Blend from Wyeast. I have made great beers with this blend alone, but it does take time to mature.
After a long time maturing, the Flanders red may become too sour to be enjoyable on its own, so I blend it with a second “clean” beer to cut the acidity, and reintroduce some malt backbone, sweetness, and complexity.
The second beer this year was a saison. My brew club friend Mark Pennick had a simple house saison that had just finished primary fermentation. Mark has won NHC gold in the past for his specialty saison. He gave me 2.5 gal. of his basic saison. He says:
In a grain bag, steep specialty grains in 158°F (70°C) water. Use a 10-gallon kettle with enough room for full volume boil of extract. Pre-boil volume of 7.5 gal. (28.4 L) to make 6.5 gal. (24.6 L). Hop per schedule. Pitch 1 L starter of WLP568 to have at least 265 million cells. Pitch at 72°F (22°C) and hold at that temperature for at least 10 days, maybe up to 14 days.
I pasteurized the Flanders red because I didn’t want those microbes to sour the clean saison addition. I heated the red to 135°F (57°C) and held for 30 min. I then chilled it to 70°F (21°C) and blended it with the saison. We sampled different blending ratios and liked 1:1 the most.
I had some Cabernet Sauvignon grape juice concentrate from a 1-gallon wine kit I had never made and decided to experiment. I added the 1.32-liter bag of concentrate to referment the blended beer. After it was done, I added priming sugar to achieve about 2 vol. (4 5/L) of CO2 and bottled. Let the bottles condition for at least a month, but longer is better.
Crafting sours is more of an art than a science. You can alter many of these steps and make an exceptional product. Don’t be afraid to taste test over time, experiment with something new, and change course as you go.",

Pitched Roeselare Ale Blend and added dregs from a few wild fermentation beers I enjoyed. Fermented at basement temperatures between 62°F (17°C) and 72°F (22°C) year-round.
Brewed this five times over the course of about 14 months with minor variations due to ingredients on hand in order to step up the culture by re-pitching fresh wort on yeast cake/culture and transferring clearing wort into secondary fermenter. When this was done, the secondary vessel was purged with CO2 prior to and following the transfer. With first addition to secondary fermenter maltodextrin was added, along with bottle dregs from multiple high-quality wild beers, and a packet of Brettanomyces Bruxellensis. Also, occasionally added bottle dregs throughout fermentation when I came across an especially good wild beer in order to increase the diversity of bacteria and yeast in the culture. Aged one year in secondary before bottling.
Bottled using Champagne yeast and corn sugar to 3 vol. (6 g/L) CO2 guessing it would end up slightly lower due to aging time.",

I typically brew my ales as 5-gallon batches on the Grainfather G30. I use Chicago-area Lake Michigan water, which has a pH of 7.9. With all the roasted malt, you don’t need lactic acid to achieve a suitable mash pH. I add 2 g baking soda to boost the pH to 5.4–5.5, which I find helps with this style. Also, I always add potassium metabisulfite to eliminate chlorine. I acidified the sparge water to a pH of around 5.5.
Omega Yeast is local to the Chicago area. I have had great experience with getting very fresh, viable yeast and therefore can simply pitch yeast packets directly for fermentation. For this batch, I pitched one yeast packet.",

This recipe is intended to be “pumpkin pie in a glass.” The combination of malts provides the sweet, crackery crust; butternut squash provides more “pumpkin” flavor in beer than canned or even fresh pumpkin; the spices give classic pumpkin-pie flavor; and lactose and vanilla supply body, subtle sweetness, and the perception of the whipped cream on top. Cube and roast 5 lb. (2.27 kg) butternut squash sprinkled with a few tablespoons of brown sugar at 350°F (176.7°C) until caramelized and soft, about 1 hour. Treat water with lactic acid to achieve a 5.2 mash pH. Mash at 155°F (68°C) for about 60 min. Run off and sparge as usual. Add butternut squash to the boil in a nylon bag and boil for 60 min. At end of boil, remove squash and add kettle spices, lactose, and Whirlfloc. Chill, aerate well and ferment in low 60s °F (16–18°C). At kegging, add remaining spices and the split, scraped vanilla bean—vanilla and spices are added directly to the keg, so use a bag or a dip tube screen if needed. The keys to making a standout beer are to use fresh spices, a high quality vanilla bean, and a larger pitch of yeast than you think you need.",

Use a no-sparge BIAB method. The large grain bill and lack of sparge lowers efficiency, so fermentables are supplemented with DME. The larger batch size compensates for hop absorption and yields a full 5-gallon keg. Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 60 min. Add FWH, then bring to a boil for 75 min. Add DME if gravity needs a boost. Reduce wort temperature to 170°F (77°C) and add INCOGNITO and whirlpool hops. Use multiple yeast packets, or a stepped starter to achieve 400 billion cells. Begin fermentation at 68°F (20°C) and let free rise to 72°F (22°C). Soft crash to 50°F (10°C) on day 12, drop yeast, dry hop for 3 days, then drop temperature to 35°F (2°C) and perform a closed transfer to a CO2-purged keg.

Mash all grains (except the acidulated malt) at 152°F at 1.33 qts/lb. Hold for 45 min and then add the acidulated malt and enough water to keep the water-to-grain ratio. Hold for 45 more minutes and then sparge with 168°F (75.6°C) water. These two steps take more time, but they will allow for the pH drop without affecting conversion.
Boil for 1 hour, adding the hops, bitter orange peel, and Whirlfloc at the indicated times. Chill to 65°F and pitch the starter immediately. Let free-rise to 70°F (21.1°C), but no higher if possible.
WLP007 finishes super fast. If you made that starter and pitched at high krausen, it will be done and cleaned up after itself in 2-3 days.

Robby shares this about his award-winning pilsner:
Saw Down Unda completes the perfect hoppy, but still crispy Pilsner, making it a perfect drinker for any day of the year. The Enigma and Galaxy hops from Yakima Valley Hops bring a nice tropical and white grape aroma to the light, crispy Pilsner that makes it very enjoyable. The malts used in this are locally grown grains in Eastern Washington and then malted at LINC malt out of Spokane. This brings a grain character to the brew that makes it stand out with some great hay/warm brown bread aromas. This beer will bring your tastes from the farmland where the grain is grown to the tropical fruit hop flavors of the southern hemisphere.","Ingredients:

The following recipe was originally featured in the article “Small Batch Brewing” by Dan Jablow (Jan/Feb 2023 Zymurgy magazine).
Here’s the full recipe for my SMaSH ale, which I still brew frequently to experiment with new hops, yeast, malt, or brewing processes. I typically use a two-row pale malt.
This recipe is designed with the novice brewer in mind, so I’ve skipped some key steps here, including water chemistry adjustments and gravity readings. These can certainly help you make great beer, but a good understanding of techniques, process, and gaining comfort with your brewing setup are much more important as you get started.
Bitterness will vary with the hops you select. Consider starting with a variety that offers moderate alpha acids, such as Cascade, to establish a baseline. The next time you brew, you can try a higher- or lower-alpha hop for more or less bitterness.","Ingredients:
MALT
2.25 lb. (1.02 kg) milled base malt of your choice
HOPS
0.5 oz. (14 g) any hop of your choice @ 60 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) the same hop @ 15 min
0.25 oz. (7 g) the same hop @ 0 min
YEAST
Any variety of yeast will work. I recommend starting with a dry yeast, as it is easy to measure the amount required for a 1-gallon batch. Fermentis and Lallemand both make excellent dry yeasts in 11-gram packets, enough to brew a typical 5-gallon batch. Since we’re only brewing a single gallon, we need one-fifth of that packet, or 2.2 grams. Having the jeweler’s scale here is helpful. Tightly package up any remaining yeast and store in the refrigerator for future use.
WATER
1 gal. (3.8 L) for mashing
0.75 gal (2.8 L) for sparging
Specifications:
Yield: 1 US gal. (3.8 L)
Original Gravity: 1.055-1.065
Final Gravity: varies with yeast selection
ABV: varies with yeast selection
IBU: varies with hop selection
SRM: 4-10 (depending on malt selection)","Directions:
Heat 1 gal. (3.8 L) water to 160°F (71°C). Add the milled malt and mash at 147-150°F (64-66°C) for 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, increase the temperature of the mash to 170°F (77°C) and hold 10 minutes for mash out.
While you’re mashing out, heat 0.75 gallon of water to 170°F (77°C) in a separate pot. Set a large mesh strainer over a third pot, 12 qt. Cambro, or other large vessel and pour the mash through the strainer to separate the wort out from the spent grains. Slowly pour the sparge water over the spent grain until you’ve collected about 5.5-6 qt. (5.2-5.7 L) of wort.
Pour the wort into a pot and bring to a boil. Watch closely, as boil-overs can happen. Add the 60-minute hop addition once the wort comes to a boil. With 15 minutes remaining, add the second hop addition, and at the end of the hour-long boil, add the final hop addition.
Chill the wort down to the recommended yeast-pitching temperature by placing the entire pot into an ice bath in your sink. When the wort has reached the appropriate temperature for yeast pitching, transfer it to a clean, sanitized fermentation vessel. Make sure that anything that touches the wort from this point on is sanitized.
Add the yeast to the wort, close the fermentation vessel, and shake it vigorously on and off for about 45 seconds to create it. Run a blow-off tube from the fermenter to a jar or a small pot filled with sanitizer. This will prevent air from entering the soon-to-be beer but will all CO2 to escape.
Within 12-24 hours there will be a decent amount of bubbling that will quiet down after about 3-4 days. Once this happens you can replace the blow-off tube with an airlock. Two weeks later, fermentation will be complete and you can package your beer in bottles or a keg.",

Access this issue along with the archives with Zymurgy Online!
AHA member Marshall Bishop loves Tree House Julius so much that he has devoted untold hours to developing a faithful homebrew clone, the recipe for which he has kindly shared with us. Marshall offers helpful advice for brewing this recipe.
Water chemistry, a specific combination of yeasts, plus acids and essential oils from the hops combine to give this beer its hazy appearance. Tree House doesn’t use flaked grains.
Minimizing calcium in the brewing water contributes a soft mouthfeel. Hard water ions such as magnesium and calcium can contribute chalky, thick sensations – if you want softness in a beer, start with soft water. Using canning salt (sodium chloride) provides chloride without adding calcium.
The long whirlpool at 108°F (42°C) extracts and retains volatile hop flavor and aroma compounds that would otherwise evaporate at higher temperatures. You can replace the whirlpool with a hop stand to maximize contact between hops and wort, but you will get the best utilization from constantly stirring during whirlpool.
Dried yeast has sufficient sterols for healthy fermentation, so there’s no need to aerate or oxygenate. You want to stress the yeast enough to encourage ester production. Esters and other complex fruity, yeast-derived flavors match perfectly with the hop-derived fruity flavors and aromas. Resist the temptation to round up the specified quantities of WB-06 and T-58 if you can’t measure less than one gram, as these will dominate the clean strain and add too much farmhouse character.
Pitching warm and then cooling the fermentation encourages ester production while retaining volatile aromatic compounds. You still want some yeast activity when adding the dry hops, more to prevent oxidation than for any biotransformation mumbo jumbo.
Dry hopping in a mesh bag is not recommended. You’ll get better wort contact by letting the pellet hops dissolve and float free in the primary. Cold crashing won’t clear the beer of hop/polyphenol haze, but it will settle yeast.","Ingredients:

Mash at 156°F (69°C) for one hour, adjusting pH to 5.2 with citric acid if necessary. Mash out at 168°F (76°C). Fly sparge at 168-170°F (76-77°C). Don’t use Whirlfloc or Irish moss in the boil. Chill to 108°F (42°C) and add whirlpool hops, stirring or whirlpooling to keep hops in suspension for 60 minutes. Chill to 70°F (21°C) and pitch dry yeast blend; do not pitch more WB-06 and T-58 than specified, as they will dominate the clean base strain. There is no need to hydrate the dry yeast prior to pitching and no need to aerate or oxygenate the wort. After 24 hours, lower fermentation temperature gradually to 64°F (18°C) over a 60-hour period, let fermentation run at 64° F for 4-5 days depending on yeast activity, and then add the dry hops to primary and ferment to completion (usually about 2 days). Take care to minimize oxygen uptake at all times after fermentation. Cold crash to 32°F (0°C) for 2 days, then closed-transfer to a keg and force carbonate.",

For the final episode in the trilogy—Return of the Jedi (1983)—Pop Culture Brews cohost Andrew Sanders crafted a pale ale recipe reminiscent of Endor, the forest moon that is home to the furry and ferocious Ewoks.
Andrew wanted Return of the Jedi Pale Ale to have more piney and earthy hop notes to reflect the forest setting of the final battle between the Rebels and the evil Empire. As a result, Return of the Jedi Pale Ale uses the same grist as A New Hope Pale Ale, but changes the dry hop additions to Simcoe and Chinook for a more West Coast-style hop.

For the second episode in the trilogy—The Empire Strikes Back (1980)—Pop Culture Brews cohost Paul Crowther (aka The Mad Brewer) created a beer recipe that captures the film’s darker, more sinister tone.
Adding Carafa III, a dark-roasted barley, makes the recipe darker (~45 SRM) and instills some mild roasted notes in the aftertaste. While this beer is impenetrably dark compared to its Episode IV predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back Dark Ale is still bursting full of Citra hop flavor, reflecting the lighter moments of Episode V.

Disclaimer: Gas in any pressurized environment is a dangerous thing. Check the blowoffs of any pressurized equipment with the supplier before attempting anything outside its design spec.
Keg beer and build the carbonation level to 1.2 vol. (2.4 g/L) of CO2.
Add nitrogen. The method I would recommend for a home setup is to push nitrogen through a carbonation lid (a special lid with a sintered stone) on a Corny keg. Corny kegs can comfortably take 45 psi of nitrogen.
Bring the keg to 2.2 bar (32 psi) or as high as 3 bar (44 psi) if possible and allow the nitrogen to slowly dissolve. This takes some time, and without gas testing equipment, the pour is your only indication.
Pour at a top pressure of 38 psi (2.6 bar) through a creamer nozzle, ideally with nitrogen top pressure so as to avoid any further carbonation pickup. A full pint at 4–6°C (39–43°F) will take 2 minutes to settle and will have 10–15 mm (about 0.5”) of head depending on the shape of the glassware.
Send me a picture of said pint with plenty of details on how it’s drinking."

Peter Symons created this modern version of an American sparkling ale based on an original recipe dating back to September 6, 1904. 
The origins of American sparkling ale, sometimes called cold sparkling ale (remember: nothing is new!) around the turn of the 20th century, seem to lie in the need for ale breweries to have a product to compete with later beers. 
The original method was to make a blend of stored and mature ale, with lager kraeusen and so to create a brew that to all appearances was lager beer, but of a decided ale flavor and character. This type of ale was served in bottles as well as on draught.
The requirements for Sparkling Ale included; to brew an ale more palatable, good foam stability, palate-fullness, sparkling to the eye, chill proof, with an appreciable fineness of flavor and aroma of hops and malt, and the characteristic esters of top fermented beers. ","Ingredients:

This modern take on a Japanese rice lager is dry and refreshing. The tropical, citrusy flavor will allow you to test the effect of whirlpool hopping temperature on the “juiciness” of the finished beer.
You can brew two beers separately from scratch or boil one wort and divide it into two batches at knockout to try two whirlpool addition temperatures, one at 90°C (194°F) and the other at 70°C (158°F). Or, just choose either of the two whirlpool temperatures, brew, and enjoy!","Ingredients:

This series takes a deep dive into commonly held brewing beliefs in pursuit of reaching a verdict on their plausibility. 
“Bush telly” is Aussie slang for a campfire or for looking at the stars while sleeping in your swag (a kind of Australian bivvy bag). Featuring Aussie Galaxy and Eclipse hops, this modern take on the good, old thirst-quenching, highly drinkable Australian sparkling ale, very dry and highly carbonated, will have you looking at the stars. It will also allow you to test how pH can affect perceived bitterness, which is one of the reasons why the IBU scale is not helpful for gauging beer bitterness.
To test this impact, you just need to brew the recipe once and then do a triangle test between the original beer and the same beer with the addition of either phosphoric or lactic acid to reduce the pH by at least 0.2 points. To do this, we suggest serving two pitchers of the beer and adding the acid to one of them, drop by drop, until the pH drops, for example, from 4.3 to 4 or 4.1. Once achieved, do the triangle test to assess which beer feels more bitter. It’s the same base beer with the same IBUs and even the same IBU/OG ratio. The only change is the final pH.
If you can’t get your hands on Eclipse hops, Enigma is a good substitute from Australia. Or, stick with the celestial theme by substituting Ekuanot (formerly known as Equinox) or Comet. If Super Pride hops are hard to come by, try swapping in Centennial.","Ingredients:

The winning entry was a blend of seven beers. The recipe provided here is the bulk of the blend. My approach is to make several sour stock beers, age them 6 months or so, brew/ferment some fresh saison for the blending day, and then blend to balance/taste prior to adding any adjuncts.
My sour stocks finish so sour that I often need a considerable portion of non-sour beer to balance it out. I aim for final pH of 3.4–3.5 (definitely trying to avoid anything lower than 3.2), so I often shoot higher than that prior to adding fruit, as fruit may lower the pH even further.
Prior to adding fruit, this beer was a 10:1:1:1:1 blend of the Nelson Saison recipe provided here (pH 4.05, FG 1.005), a rye sour (pH 3.25, FG 1.004), two blond sours (pH 2.96, FG 1.004 and pH 2.89, FG 1.003), and a spontaneous sour (pH 3.2, FG 1.003). This blend resulted in a pH of 3.5 before the fruit addition.
I racked about 3 gal. (11.4 L) of this blend onto 17 lb. (7.7 kg) of fresh farmers market peaches (four different varieties, frozen, then thawed prior to adding) to achieve about 5 gal. (18.9 L) total. After six weeks on fruit, the beer pH had risen to 3.7, so I blended in some new blond sour stock and some sour stock that had aged on 4 cumaru seeds per gal., at a ratio of 1:.25:.25 to reach a bottling pH of 3.4 (the seeds had been crushed and soaked in Amburana-barrel-aged cachaça for a few weeks prior to being added to the sour stock). Using the Rare Barrel’s terminal acid shock starter method, this beer was then bottle conditioned with corn sugar in thick brown Belgian bottles to achieve 3.3 vol. (6.6 g/L) CO2. The beer was about 6 months old in the bottle when it was judged.
Making the Nelson Saison: Single infusion mash at 147°F (64°C) for 60 minutes. Target a mash pH of 5.4 and post-boil pH of 5.05. Begin open fermentation (foil on carboy, etc.) at 65°F (18°C), then after 3 days of active fermentation, slowly rise to 75°F (24°C) over the course of several days. Add sugar addition when beer is about 75% fermented (approximately 1.015 SG) and install airlock for remainder of fermentation.
Making sour stock: Sour stock is fairly forgiving. I typically do a 60/40 blend of Pils (or pale malt) and wheat malt, shooting for an OG of 1.045–1.052 and about 4 IBUs. Pitch any Saccharomyces strain and a sour culture blend (and possibly some additional Brettanomyces). The sour stocks used in this beer relied mostly on Bootleg Biology and Yeast Bay sour blend cultures. Fill carboy nearly to the brim with chilled wort, pitch entire mixed culture into primary, wait 6 months (without opening the carboy), then proceed to blending session. Do not let oxygen touch this beer until blending day (brew day oxidation is okay, though). Dump any beers that are acetic or failed to ferment (this should be very rare if you follow the directions here).
A note on the cumaru: I did not mention the cumaru in my NHC entry notes, as I was afraid judges would not know enough about the ingredient, and knowing about it might throw them off. The entry was entered as ‘33C – Wild Specialty (28C): aged w/Peaches.’ The cumaru accented the peaches nicely, making the beer even “peachier” to my palate.",

Efficiency: 78%","Directions:
I prefer working in percentages where possible—the grist for this recipe is 78% Pilsner malt, 20% flaked wheat, and 2% sugar. I’m a huge fan of low-oxygen brewing, reducing hot-side aeration where possible, and being gentle as possible throughout the brewing process. This produces the cleanest, brightest beer possible.
I start by de-oxygenating all my brewing liquor by boiling the entire amount first, then cooling it down to my mash strike temperature. I treat the entire brewing liquor with all minerals (mash and sparging water together) to a 1:2 ratio of sulfate to chloride after the de-oxygenating boil, but before cooling. Do not exceed 100 ppm chloride.
Acidify all of the brewing liquor using lactic acid to achieve a mash pH between 5.1 and 5.3. Mash for 45–60 minutes at 145–147°F (63–64°C). Mash pH should fall between 5.1 and 5.3, but add additional acid if the pH is above 5.3. Gently vorlauf for 20 to 25 minutes or until runoff is very clear. Sparge until the full volume is achieved in the kettle, stop sparging if gravity falls below 1.010, and top up the kettle with excess brewing liquor to achieve the full boil volume.
Boil for 90 minutes. At 60 minutes add the CO2 hop extract, targeting 30 IBUs. After the boil, cool the wort down to 170–160°F (77–71°C). Add the remaining hops, shooting for roughly 1 oz./gal. (7.5 g/L). Whirlpool the hops and let the hops and trub settle for 25–30 minutes. Cool the wort to 67°F (19°C) and rack into the fermenter.
Oxygenate the wort at 1.5 L/min for 1 to 2 minutes with pure O2. Pitch one pack of Rustic Imperial yeast or Wyeast 3726 Farmhouse Ale Yeast for 200 billion or 1.04M cells/mL/°P. Hold temperature at 67–70°F (19–21°C) for first 24 hours, then let the fermentation free-rise to 95–100°F (35–38°C). Hold that temperature until fermentation is complete. Near the tail end of the fermentation (around 1.010/2.6°P or so), attach a spunding valve. Crash cool and condition for 1 to 2 weeks at 32°F (0°C). Force carbonate to 2.7–3 vol. (5.4–6 g/L) of CO2.",

The base wort came from one of my homebrew club’s sponsor breweries—Mash Lab in Windsor Colo.—via their amazing brewer Ryan Joy. The high-gravity second runnings came in around 1.080 from a triple-mashed single batch he was kind enough to share.
Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 60 minutes, targeting a mash pH of 5.4. Sparge to hit pre-boil volume appropriate for 90-minute boil. Run off one extra gallon (3.8L) into a second pot or kettle; start a side boil on this pot to transform the wort into a melanoidin-rich malt syrup—without scorching!—and add back to main boil.
Add plenty of oxygen, pitch a large yeast starter, and ferment for the first 3 days at 62°F (17°C). After 3 days, warm fermenter to 68–70°F (20–21°C) for a diacetyl rest. Then rack to a rum barrel to sleep for 6 months or until desired character is achieved.
Meanwhile, prepare two infusions in two Mason jars: one of cassia cinnamon and vodka and another of three scrapped, chopped Madagascar vanilla beans and vodka. Let those jars get happy while the beer ages. Dose your racked beer to taste, about 30 mL each per 5-gallon keg.",

“A favorite summer movie of mine is the kid baseball classic The Sandlot.

Andrew Sanders shares the homebrew recipe for this west coast-style IPA from his show Pop Culture Brews–a podcast with his pal Tyler about pop culture and the beer it inspires.
Twin Pines IPA is made for Back to the Future and honors the Twin Pines Mall, which later becomes Lone Pine Mall.
“This used to be Twin Pines Mall in the 1985 I knew first time around. But when I went back, I accidentally ran over one of the farmer’s pines. I guess that’s why they call it Lone Pine Mall now.” – Marty McFly

Tha CommUNITY American Lager was contributed by April Dove, a homebrewer in South Carolina, using her brewing education to make a difference in the brewing community.
In 2021, Dove (also known as The Traveling Hoptista) started a multi-brew initiative to offer a more diverse and inclusive taproom experience throughout the tri-county Charleston region. These efforts led her to release an American lager (Tha CommUNITY) in partnership with Holy City Brewing and become the first Black woman to do so.
Her career highlights not only include brewing a flavorful and inclusive beer but for the City of North Charleston to recognize October 1st annually as Tha CommUNITY Day. April loves what she does and hopes to diversify the palate of her community “one beer at a time”, follow her at @thacommunity.brew.
This simple and delicious American lager is an approachable first step into lagering since the temperature can easily be achieved with something like a cold water bath, towel, and fan.","Ingredients:

https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/jen-blairs-american-style-barleywine/,Not Found,"Jen Blair—American Homebrewers Association Governing Committee Member, Advanced Cicerone, and National BJCP beer judge—shares a beer recipe for her American-style barleywine.
What’s significant to you about this homebrew recipe?
Barleywine is one of my favorite beer styles. This was my first homebrew recipe to win a medal in a homebrew competition. Over the years, I’ve won a handful of awards with this recipe.
The finished beer is a beautiful deep-red color and has a rich dark cherry and caramel flavor. It finishes with moderate alcohol warmth. Although I consider barleywine a year-round option, it’s the perfect beer to brew in the late summer and let mellow for a few months to break out on that first cold weekend of the year.
This barleywine recipe is also very forgiving and an excellent basis to experiment with different hops and specialty malts. I brew it a little differently each time, depending on what hops I have on hand and what brewing equipment I’m using.
Tell us about homebrewing this recipe!
It’s an adventure in fitting all of the grain into the mash tun each time I brew it. Homebrewing requires a certain degree of flexibility! The first time, the mash tun was filled to the brim and even overflowed a little bit.
The next time I brewed the recipe, I brewed 15 gallons destined for a bourbon barrel, so the recipe was divided into three 5-gallon batches, which made for a long brew day. I somehow forgot to add some of the grain to the second batch, but I was able to make up the loss of gravity with DME (dry malt extract) I had on hand—a technique I learned on the fly.
The last time I made it was with new homebrewing equipment (a Brewzilla), and I discovered almost too late that all of the grain would not fit into the vessel. I decided to employ the reiterative mashing technique, also known as a poly-gyle (not to be confused with parti-gyle). This technique uses multiple mashes, with the wort from the previous batch being used as the liquor for the next until you hit your target gravity.
About Jen
I began homebrewing in 2014. My boyfriend (now husband) and I shared a love of beer, and he was learning to homebrew from one of his friends. I really enjoy cooking and discovering the “how” behind the “why,” so learning how to make beer was a natural step for me.
We dove straight into all-grain homebrewing, although I’ve done a few extract batches over the years. My very first homebrew recipe was a pale ale bittered with marigolds. I remember it being very bitter, but it was mine, and it came from an idea that I came up with, so I loved it!","Ingredients:

Recipe courtesy of Tony Simmons
Tony Simmons of Pagosa Brewing in Colorado was up for a challenge in 2012 when he was invited to Big Beers, Belgians, and Barleywines in Vail, Colo. They dared him to create a big beer that had not yet been produced commercially at that time, a double black imperial IPA. The most extreme yet deceptively quaffable IPA they’ve ever crafted, Double Black is not for the faint of heart. It isn’t just dark in color, but it has both distinct hop sensations and black malt flavors. This beer was first featured during the opening reception of the Big Beers Festival in January 2012. It’s said to pair well with pork empanadas.","Ingredients:

Mash grains at 153°F (67°C) for 60 minutes. Ferment at 68°F (20°C). Notes: Be aware that you will lose quite a lot of wort to the massive amount of hops. If you can exceed 75 percent efficiency, try to collect extra wort. But don’t over-sparge. You will need to use a yeast starter for this brew. If possible, use pure oxygen when pitching yeast to reduce the ester profile.","Extract Version:
Substitute 6.6 lb. pale liquid malt extract and 1.5 lb. light dry malt extract for Maris Otter malt. Steep remaining grains at 156°F (69°C) for 30 minutes with mash hops and first wort hops, strain, add malt extract, bring to boil, and proceed with recipe as above."

Irish red ale can be found on the style scale somewhere between pale ale and a brown ale. Similar to English or Scottish ales’ caramel sweetness, but with a more grainy, bready malt flavor and a very approachable ABV. The deep red comes from the roasted malt – enough to achieve flavor but not enough to morph the beer into a true brown.

First, source a fresh or full rye whiskey barrel. I was able to get a 15-gallon (57-liter) barrel from a local distiller and arrived just as they were emptying it. This batch is based on half of what was needed to fill the barrel, so I brewed it twice.
Mash at 156°F (69°C) for a full body. Pull 1.5 gal. (5.7 L) of first runnings to the boil kettle. Boil this down, stirring continuously, to yield a caramelized syrup. Add the remainder of the wort to collect a pre-boil volume of about 11 gal. (41.6 L) aiming for a finished wort volume of 8 gal. (30.3 L).
Add all the hops at 60 minutes, then a fining agent near the end of boil. Cool, transfer to fermenter, pitch yeast, and ferment at 68°F (20°C).
Brew recipe twice to yield enough beer to fill the barrel. When both batches have completed fermentation, transfer immediately to the freshly emptied barrel. Do not rinse or flush the barrel before use. After 2 weeks, transfer from barrel to kegs and age for 9 months or more. When you remember you have these kegs, sample to taste and put on tap.

Prepare a 1.5 L yeast starter about 2 days prior to pitching yeast.
If you’re not looking to win any competitions, feel free to skip the step mash. It’s a lot of extra work for a fairly minimal gain. But if you want to try out the step mash and don’t have a mash tun with a heating element try a decoction mash.
Mash in at 113°F (45°C) and rest 30 minutes. Use a heating element or decoctions to achieve rests at 135°F (57°C) for 30 minutes, 156°F (69°C) for 30 minutes, and 168°F (76°C) for 10 minutes. The rice hulls add no sugar or flavor, but help to prevent a stuck mash. If you’re not used to brewing with wheat, do not skimp on the rice hulls; they could save you a lot of time. On a Brewzilla, I find I need a full pound (about half a kilogram) of rice hulls to prevent a stuck mash.
Drain mash tun and sparge with 168°F (76°C) water until you have 7 gal. (26.5 L) of pre-boil wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding Tettnang hops at the start of the boil. Add Whirlfloc tablet 5 minutes before the end of boil. Chill wort to 75°F (24°C), transfer to fermenter, and pitch yeast starter. Expect a very active fermentation—use a blowoff tube rather than an airlock. Lower the temperature of the fermenter to 68°F (20°C) when you see signs of activity. Allow fermentation to run for two weeks.
Fermentation temperature control is key to success with this recipe since so much of the flavor comes from the yeast. If you don’t have any special equipment for controlling the temperature, I suggest putting your carboy into a large bucket of water to help stabilize the temperature, like the buckets you use to ice your keg at a party. You can also take temperature readings of the water a couple times a day the first couple of days and adjust using warm water or ice as needed.
Bottle with 4 oz. (113 g) corn sugar and condition at room temperature for 3 weeks.",

When it got to around 100°F (38°C), I switched to pre-chilled water and was able to crash the beer into the kettle to about 70°F (21°C) while it whirlpooled. Then I let it settle for about 20 minutes and pumped it to the fermenter, leaving a very large amount of trub and hops material in the kettle. You must be very careful not to contaminate the wort when doing this, but for this beer it is very important to have as little trub in the fermenter as possible. I have conicals, so after the beer settled overnight to its pitching temperature of 48°F (9°C) I also dumped a small amount of trub. If you don’t have a conical, consider doing the kettle cooling method.
Fermentation performance is paramount for this beer. This particular batch was a 4th-generation pitch after a series of helles lagers. My yeast collection process is to crash the beer, dump out the bottom layer, collect all of the middle layer and a little of the top layer of yeast, and store it at 35°F (2°C). On brew day, I decant the old beer off of the yeast and add some of the 70°F (21°C) wort without aeration or a stir plate . Since the yeast is cold this usually settles the pitch at the target temperature of 48°F (9°C). I’ll hold it there overnight while the main batch cools to that temperature.
The result is a high kräusen pitch the next morning that’s ready to be added to the main batch. After oxygenating the main batch, I’ll then gently swirl the pitch and pour all of it in, probably pitching more than the recommended 1.5 million cells/mL/°P. I leave any brown or dark-colored yeast stuck to the bottom of the starter flask.
Ramp the temperature from 48°F (9°C) to 62°F (17°C) during fermentation, making your first temperature increase once the beer has attenuated 50% and making temperature bumps at 75% and 90% attenuation milestones. Hold at 62°F (17C) until it passes a forced diacetyl test. I believe that you need to slowly cool lagers and not crash them so that there is still some yeast activity present for lagering. Cool slowly, about 2-3°F (1–1.5°C) per day, down to 33-35°F (1–2°C) and then rack to a purged keg with some Biofine Clear and a floating dip tube. Place it on CO2 at about 10 psi (690 mbar) and wait a month. Undoubtedly, you’ll start drinking it after about a week, but it really does get nice and crisp after a month. This particular batch was judged about 4 months from brew day.",

SRM: 4
Efficiency: 85%","Directions:
Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 60 minutes with half of the total water (approx. 4.8 gal. or 18.2 L). Target a mash pH of 5.3. Run off mash, then batch sparge with second half of water (approx. 4.8 gal. or 18.2 L) with a temperature that brings the grain bed to 168°F (76°C). Let sit for 10 minutes, then run off into the kettle.
Boil wort long enough to achieve a post-boil volume of 5.75 gal. (21.8 L), about 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Chill wort to 52°F (11°C) and pitch starter of Imperial Harvest at 1.5 M cells/ml/°P.
When activity slows (or apparent attenuation reaches roughly 50%), start raising the temperature by 3°F (1.7°C) per day until it reaches 65°F (18°C). Rest for another 2 days at this temperature before cold crashing and packaging. Force carbonate to your preferred level—I targeted 2.4 vol. (4.8 g/L) CO2.",

Recipe courtesy of Peter Terzian of the Brandon Bootleggers Homebrew club.
A homebrew club in the next county to the north opened up its combination fundraiser and competition to other clubs in the area. One of our members had entered it last year and told us about it at a meeting. This year, three members of the Brandon Bootleggers Homebrew Club entered beers.
The competition is called the Iron Homebrewer, maybe because you need an iron gut to drink some of the concoctions that brewers come up with. Each entrant gets a randomly drawn unusual ingredient—I was assigned the best ingredient: barbecue sauce! What better base beer for this ingredient than rauchbier?
The challenge would be to develop a recipe with gentle smoke flavor and the right amount of sauce. My beer must have worked because I received many positive comments, such as “I could drink this all afternoon while I’m grilling” and “This is the best beer you’ve ever brewed!”
I only made 3 gallons because I didn’t want to waste a lot of time and ingredients on a beer that I might have to throw out. Turns out I didn’t make enough! We blew the keg before the event was over, and it was judged in the top 5 of 25 beers!","Ingredients:
